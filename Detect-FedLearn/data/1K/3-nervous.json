    "abstract": "Does carotid restenosis predict an increased risk of late symptoms, stroke, or death? The identification of carotid restenosis as an unexpected late complication of carotid endarterectomy has prompted concerns regarding its importance as a source of new cerebral symptoms, stroke, and death. To investigate these concerns, we analyzed a consecutive series of 507 patients undergoing 566 carotid endarterectomies, each documented as technically satisfactory. Post-operative duplex Doppler examination data at 3 days, 1, 3, 6, 12 months, and annually thereafter in 484 arteries (85.5%) permitted classification of these arteries according to the most severe degree of postoperative stenosis: normal (n = 306); 1% to 19% (n = 89); 20% to 50% (n = 40); more than 50% (n = 49, including 8 occluded). The incidence of more than 50% restenosis was 14.5% in female and 7.7% in male patients (p = 0.003). Life table analyses to 10 years revealed a significantly greater life expectancy among those with restenosis (p = 0.05). Stroke was also less likely in patients with restenosis, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. When survival and stroke were both endpoints, the likelihood of patients with more than 50% restenosis remaining alive and stroke free was also greater than the less than 20% stenotic group (p = 0.03). Thus patients with carotid restenosis were less likely than patients with normal postoperative scans to have late symptoms, stroke, or early death."

One hundred shoulders were assessed in 50 patients with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, of which one-third were found to have bilateral symptoms. Two distinct clinical and radiological groups emerged. Those with minor epiphyseal abnormalities developed painful osteoarthritis in middle age, but retained shoulder movement until the secondary changes were advanced. Those with 'hatchet head' shoulders likewise became painful in the fifth and sixth decades but had minimal glenohumeral movement from an early stage."

    "abstract": "Effects of lactulose and lactitol on protein digestion and metabolism in conventional and germ free animal models: relevance of the results to their use in the treatment of portosystemic encephalopathy. Protein digestion and metabolism have been studied in laboratory rats and miniature pigs to investigate the mechanisms of action of lactulose and lactitol when used in the treatment of patients with portosystemic encephalopathy. Lactulose (beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-beta-D-fructofuranose) and lactitol (beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----4)-D-glucitol) increased the excretion of nitrogenous material in the faeces and decreased nitrogen excretion in the urine in a similar degree to that reported for human patients. In studies with germ free rats given lactulose no such effect was observed, suggesting that, for lactulose at least, these effects are mediated by the gut flora. Measurement of the alpha-, epsilon-diaminopimelic acid content of the faeces confirmed that the enhancement of faecal nitrogen was due to an increased contribution from bacteria. The similarity in the results for lactulose and lactitol suggests that, from the perspective of protein metabolism, lactitol acts in a similar way to lactulose in the treatment of portosystemic encephalopathy."

    "abstract": "Bimanual simultaneous motor performance and impaired ability to shift attention in Parkinson's disease. The ability to share time and to shift attention between bimanual simultaneous motor tasks were studied in 18 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 19 age- and intelligence-matched controls. The task consisted of drawing triangles with the dominant hand and squeezing a rubber bulb with the nondominant hand. Motor performance was measured using the variables: amplitude of squeezing, frequency of squeezing and velocity of drawing triangles. After eliminating variance due to baseline differences in single-handed performance, the bimanual simultaneous performance of PD and controls turned out to be similar to the frequency of squeezing and the velocity of drawing triangles. The amplitude of squeezing, however, differed between the two groups: it was significantly reduced in PD. Arguably the disturbance in the bimanual performance of PD patients was not due to a disorder of time sharing, but to a decreased ability to shift attention from the visually cued task to the non visually cued task. The results agree with current evidence that PD patients are more impaired when they have to rely upon internal control for the regulation of shifting attention than when external cues are available."

    "abstract": "Cognitive and behavioural impairment among elderly people in institutions providing different levels of care. OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence and degree of cognitive and behavioural impairment in elderly patients in institutions providing different levels of care. DESIGN: Prevalence study. SETTING: A nursing home, a home for the aged and psychogeriatric wards in a provincial psychiatric hospital. PATIENTS: Only subjects 65 years of age or older were eligible for inclusion. A random sample was selected comprising 25% of the residents in the nursing home and the home for the aged; of the 119 asked to participate 95 agreed (44 in the nursing home and 51 in the home for the aged). All 50 on the psychogeriatric wards agreed to participate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Kingston Dementia Rating Scale (KDRS). RESULTS: An MMSE score of less than 24 (cognitive impairment) was given to 37 (84%) of the residents in the nursing home, 43 (84%) of those in the home for the aged and 48 (96%) of the patients in the psychiatric hospital; the corresponding numbers for a KDRS score of more than 0 (cognitive impairment) were 41 (93%), 48 (94%) and 50 (100%). The seven patients receiving the highest level of care at the home for the aged (special care) had more behavioural problems than those in the psychiatric hospital did (p less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive and behavioural impairment was widespread in the three institutions regardless of the level of care. When planning services and allocating resources government funding agencies should consider the degree and prevalence of such impairment among elderly people in institutions."

    "abstract": "Skin and epidural recording of spinal somatosensory evoked potentials following median nerve stimulation: correlation between the absence of spinal N13 and impaired pain sense. A clinical lesion study and intraoperative epidural recordings were made to test the origin and clinical significance of the spinal N13 and P13 of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) that follow median nerve stimulation. Intraoperatively, the respective peak latencies of spinal P13 and N13 coincided with those of the N1 component of the dorsal cord potential and its phase reversed positivity. On both the ventral and dorsal sides of the cervical epidural space, maximal amplitude was at the C5 vertebral level to which nerve input from the C6 dermatome is the main contributor. The modality of sensory impairment in the hand dermatome was examined in selected patients with cervical lesions, who showed such normal conventional SEP components as Erb N9, far-field P9, P11, P14, N18 and cortical N20, with or without loss of spinal N13. Statistically, the loss of spinal N13 was associated with decrease of pain sensation in the C6 dermatome. This was interpreted as being due to damage to the central grey matter of the cord, including the dorsal horn. Our results suggest the spinal N13 and P13 originate from the same source in the C6 spinal cord segment and that they are good indicators for the detection of centromedullary cervical cord damage."

    "abstract": "Effects of MK-801 on recovery from sensorimotor cortex lesions. Histologic evidence suggests that drugs acting as noncompetitive antagonists at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor can have beneficial or pathologic effects on central nervous system neurons. In the present experiments we examined the effects of MK-801 on recovery of behavioral function after unilateral lesions in the rat somatic sensorimotor cortex. In the first experiment, rats with unilateral sensorimotor cortex lesions were given either MK-801 (1 mg/kg) or saline 12-16 hours after surgery. Additional injections were given on postoperative days 2, 4, and 6. Behavioral tests measured somatosensory asymmetries (i.e., bilateral tactile stimulation tests) and forelimb placing. After creation of sensorimotor cortex lesions, rats showed an ipsilateral somatosensory bias and an impairment in placing the contralateral forelimb. Rats treated with MK-801 recovered slightly faster than saline-treated animals as measured by a bilateral tactile stimulation test (p less than 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant difference between the groups in the recovery of forelimb placing. In a second experiment, rats with sensorimotor cortex lesions were treated with a single injection of MK-801 after behavioral recovery. Twenty hours after the MK-801 injection, rats with sensorimotor cortex lesions showed a reinstatement of the placing deficits. The impairment endured for at least 7 days after injection. These behavioral data support the idea that MK-801 can have either beneficial or detrimental effects when administered after brain damage."

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging and tomographic evaluation of occlusal appliance treatment for advanced internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint. This study evaluates the positional relationship of the disc and mandibular condyle in patients with late opening clicks treated with appliance therapy. A total of 30 joints (18 patients) were studied. Twenty-seven of these 30 joints were treated with the appliance until the joints were silent to auscultation. The patients were then evaluated with axial corrected tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the centric occlusion position and with their bite appliance (Sved-type) in place. Comparisons were made between condyle position in centric occlusion and with the appliance in place. Magnetic resonance imaging was then used to evaluate disc positional changes. Each imaging procedure was made in the same sagittal plane. Only changes in condyle positioning could be identified. Evidence of disc repositioning with the appliance in place was seen in only three MRI examinations. The remaining 27 joints continued to exhibit disc displacement with various changes in disc morphology. It is concluded that the concept of \"disc capture\" is a clinical term only, and that such perceived clinical success should not lead to the assumption that an actual change in intra-articular anatomic relationships has occurred. Joint noises may decrease because joint space is increased, allowing smoother condylar translation beyond disc surface irregularities and positional abnormalities."

    "abstract": "Parathyroid hormone-related peptide in lactation and in umbilical cord blood. Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) is expressed in lactating rat mammary glands after suckling, as a result of increases in prolactin rather than suckling per se. In addition, PTHrP produced in the fetal parathyroid glands and placenta may be responsible for stimulation of placental calcium transport. In the current study, we used a radioimmunoassay for human PTHrP to measure levels of the peptide in (1) human breast milk, cow's milk, and two infant formulas; (2) sequential plasma samples in prepartum and postpartum lactating women; (3) women with pathologic hyperprolactinemia; and (4) human umbilical cord blood. In normal subjects, plasma PTHrP levels ranged from less than 2 to 5 pmol/liter. In contrast, human breast milk contained substantially increased levels of immunoreactive PTHrP. Similar elevations were found in cow's milk and in one infant formula. Column chromatography of breast milk demonstrated that PTHrP immunoreactivity included a region of adenylate cyclase stimulating activity, consistent with the presence of biologically active PTHrP. Plasma prepartum PTHrP values did not differ from corresponding postpartum values in lactating women. Women with hyperprolactinemia had a mean plasma PTHrP value in the high-normal range. Umbilical cord blood had considerably suppressed parathyroid hormone values but PTHrP levels that were indistinguishable from those in normal human plasma. Thus, PTHrP is present in high concentrations in breast milk but apparently does not gain access to the maternal circulation in significant amounts. In addition, women with pathologic hyperprolactinemia seem not to have increased levels of circulating PTHrP."

In order to generate information about the relative effectiveness of the most widely used pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for the prophylaxis of recurrent migraine (i.e., propranolol HCl and combined relaxation/thermal biofeedback training), meta-analysis was used to integrate results from 25 clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of propranolol and 35 clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of relaxation/biofeedback training (2445 patients, collectively). Meta-analysis revealed substantial, but very similar improvements have been obtained with propranolol and with relaxation/biofeedback training. When daily recordings have been used to assess treatment outcome, both propranolol and relaxation/biofeedback have yielded a 43% reduction in migraine headache activity in the average patient. When improvements have been assessed using other outcome measures (e.g., physician/therapist ratings), improvements observed with each treatment have been about 20% greater. In both cases, improvements observed with propranolol and relaxation/biofeedback have been significantly larger than improvement observed with placebo medication (14% reduction) or in untreated patients (no reduction). Meta-analysis thus revealed substantial empirical support for the effectiveness of both propranolol and relaxation/biofeedback training, but revealed no support for the contention that the two treatments differ in effectiveness. These results suggest that greater attention should be paid to determining the relative costs and benefits of widely used pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments."

The results of partial patellectomy as a treatment for displaced patellar fractures were assessed retrospectively with use of clinical, radiographic, and isokinetic strength-testing criteria. Forty patients who had been followed for an average of 8.4 years were studied. In the extremity that had been operated on, the mean active range of motion was 94 per cent, the circumference of the thigh was 100 per cent, and the strength of the quadriceps was 85 per cent of these measurements in the contralateral extremity. The over-all result was rated as excellent in twenty patients, good in eleven, fair in six, and poor in three. There was a significant statistical correlation between the type of fracture and the outcome. The results of this study indicate that partial patellectomy can be an effective treatment for selected patellar fractures."

BACKGROUND. In a controlled trial comparing acyclovir with vidarabine in the treatment of neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, we found no significant difference between the treatments in adjusted mortality and morbidity. Hence, we sought to define for the entire cohort (n = 202) the clinical characteristics that best predicted the eventual outcome in these neonates. METHODS. Data were gathered prospectively at 27 centers between 1981 and 1988 in infants less than one month of age who had virologically confirmed HSV infection. We examined the outcomes by multivariate analyses of 24 variables. Disease was classified in one of three categories based on the extent of the involvement at entry into the trial: infection confined to skin, eyes, or mouth; encephalitis; or disseminated infection. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. There were no deaths among the 85 infants with localized HSV infection. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the 46 neonates with disseminated infection (57 percent) than in the 71 with encephalitis (15 percent). In addition, the risk of death was increased in neonates who were in or near coma at entry (relative risk, 5.2), had disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (relative risk, 3.8), or were premature (relative risk, 3.7). In babies with disseminated disease, HSV pneumonitis was also associated with greater mortality (relative risk, 3.6). In the survivors, morbidity was most frequent in infants with encephalitis (relative risk, 4.4), disseminated infection (relative risk, 2.1), seizures (relative risk, 3.0), or infection with HSV type 2 (relative risk, 4.9). With HSV infection limited to the skin, eyes, or mouth, the presence of three or more recurrences of vesicles was associated with an increased risk of neurologic impairment as compared with two or fewer recurrences."

    "abstract": "Postischemic seizures and necrotizing ischemic brain damage: neuroprotective effect of postischemic diazepam and insulin. Insulin has recently been shown experimentally to modify ischemic brain damage when administered either before or after the episode of ischemia. In controlled studies in the rat, high doses of insulin (greater than or equal to 8 IU/kg) result in seizures and early death. The present study was undertaken to determine whether diazepam, a potent, centrally penetrating GABAmimetic, alone or in combination with insulin, could mitigate postischemic seizures or regional selective neuronal necrosis and infarction. Forebrain ischemia was induced in rats for 10 1/2 minutes by carotid clamping and hypotension. The animals were observed clinically until elective perfusion-fixation and quantitative pathologic examination at 1-week recovery. Diazepam, either alone or with insulin, reduced regional brain necrosis and reduced the seizure rate. Insulin alone also led to reduced regional necrosis. However, the combination of diazepam plus insulin yielded the greatest proportion of undamaged brains in the hippocampus, thalamus, and midbrain. In the neocortex, the diazepam-only group showed the greatest number of normal hemispheres. Hypothalamic infarction was eliminated by all three treatments. Seizures per se were associated with increased damage in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brainstem, irrespective of treatment group. The findings indicate that ischemic brain necrosis can be mitigated by diazepam and insulin treatment begun in the immediate postischemic period."

Postoperative venous infarction following aneurysm surgery was studied in 48 patients with anterior communicating artery aneurysms operated on through the interhemispheric approach at the acute stage of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Of 23 patients whose bridging veins were sacrificed during surgery, 11 (47.8%) showed venous infarction in the frontal lobes. In contrast, only one (5.9%) of 17 patients whose bridging veins were preserved developed cerebral edema. None of eight patients who were operated on after Day 11 (the day of SAH was defined as Day 0) showed this complication, although bridging veins were sacrificed in six of them. Venous infarction following acute aneurysm surgery tended to occur more frequently in patients of higher SAH grade and/or more advanced age, but these correlations were not significant. However, the correlation between the sacrifice of veins and venous infarction was significant (p less than 0.025). Because this potential complication may compromise the benefit of acute aneurysm surgery and cause damage, it is important to preserve the venous system and in some instances to select another surgical approach based on the pattern of venous drainage in the frontal lobe."

Cognition and comportment are subserved by interconnected neural networks that allow high-level computational architectures including parallel distributed processing. Cognitive problems are not resolved by a sequential and hierarchical progression toward predetermined goals but instead by a simultaneous and interactive consideration of multiple possibilities and constraints until a satisfactory fit is achieved. The resultant texture of mental activity is characterized by almost infinite richness and flexibility. According to this model, complex behavior is mapped at the level of multifocal neural systems rather than specific anatomical sites, giving rise to brain-behavior relationships that are both localized and distributed. Each network contains anatomically addressed channels for transferring information content and chemically addressed pathways for modulating behavioral tone. This approach provides a blueprint for reexploring the neurological foundations of attention, language, memory, and frontal lobe function."

Review of the literature suggests that our experience with central nervous system metastases is not unique, and that treatment of advanced stage transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with M-VAC may enhance the incidence of meningeal metastases. Carcinomatous meningitis, although rare, is a rapidly fatal manifestation of metastatic transitional cell carcinoma if left untreated. However, prompt diagnosis and early aggressive therapy may result in palliation and stabilization of neurologic status.

Blacks and Japanese have more intracranial occlusive cerebrovascular disease, while whites have more extracranial disease. Despite a high incidence of stroke in China, there are few formal studies of the distribution of vascular occlusive disease in Chinese populations. We compared clinical and angiographic features of 24 white and 24 Chinese patients with symptomatic occlusive cerebrovascular disease. In symptomatic vascular territories, whites had more severe (greater than or equal to 50% stenosis) extracranial lesions, while Chinese had more severe intracranial lesions. When we counted mild and severe lesions in a symptomatic territory, whites had more extracranial lesions while Chinese had more intracranial lesions. When we combined symptomatic and asymptomatic territories, whites had more extracranial lesions, while Chinese had more intracranial lesions. White patients reported more transient ischemic attacks. The distribution of lesions, however, was not explained by differences in incidence of transient ischemia, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or ischemic heart disease between the groups. The preponderance of intracranial vascular lesions in Chinese patients is similar to that seen in blacks and Japanese. Racial differences in the occurrence of extracranial and intracranial lesions raise the possibility of a different underlying pathophysiology for the 2 locations."

The relationship between pain and autonomic disturbances in cluster headache was studied in 54 patients whose attack always recurred on the same side, and in 7 others whose attack had affected either side on different occasions. In one of these seven patients, facial flushing and ocular sympathetic deficit was observed on the original side of headaches. In most patients, the orbital region was warmer on the painful side but in three cases this region was cooler during and between attacks. Lacrimation and rhinorrhoea were more common in severe attacks, and the temperature difference between the orbits increased with increasing severity of pain. These findings support the view that certain autonomic disturbances in cluster headache are provoked by pain. Residual autonomic dysfunction could influence autonomic activity during cluster headache. If so, residual dysfunction on the pain-free side could explain the dissociation between autonomic disturbances and pain observed in a few cases."

A pentobarbital challenge test corroborated butalbital dosage. The patients were given phenobarbital and caffeine which were tapered over several days. Dihydroergotamine (DHE) with metoclopramide was used (Raskin). Propranolol 60 mg bid was started. No narcotics were permitted. After hospital discharge, patients were allowed to continue subcutaneous DHE, as needed. One patient restarted BAC use after 8 months without it.

We assessed the effect of 1,3-butanediol on cerebral energy metabolism and edema after inducing multifocal brain infarcts in 108 rats by the intracarotid injection of 50-microns carbonized microspheres. An ethanol dimer that induces systemic ketosis, 25 mmol/kg i.p. butanediol was injected every 3 hours to produce a sustained increase in the plasma level of beta-hydroxybutyrate. Treatment significantly attenuated ischemia-induced metabolic changes by increasing the concentrations of phosphocreatine, adenosine triphosphate, and glycogen and by reducing the concentrations of pyruvate and lactate. Lactate concentration 2, 6, and 12 hours after embolization decreased by 13%, 44%, and 46%, respectively. Brain water content increased from 78.63% in six unembolized rats to 80.93% in 12 saline-treated and 79.57% in seven butanediol-treated rats 12 hours after embolization. (p less than 0.05). The decrease in water content was associated with significant decreases in the concentrations of sodium and chloride. The antiedema effect of butanediol could not be explained by an osmotic mechanism since equimolar doses of urea or ethanol were ineffective. Our results support the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of butanediol is mediated through cerebral utilization of ketone bodies arising from butanediol metabolism, reducing the rate of glycolysis and the deleterious accumulation of lactic acid during ischemia."

Previous studies had noted impaired odor identification, but there was no unanimity about the presence of odor detection deficits. METHOD: Odor identification was tested in 55 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 57 elderly control subjects by using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Odor detection was assessed in 46 subjects with Alzheimer's disease and 40 control subjects by using a forced-choice threshold test with geraniol as the odorant. RESULTS: Significant deficits in olfactory identification were present in subjects who were in the earliest stages of cognitive impairment, and these deficits increased as Alzheimer's disease progressed. There was some overlap in individual smell identification test scores between cognitively impaired patients and normal elderly subjects. On the other hand, odor detection deficits did not appear until Alzheimer's disease was relatively advanced. Smell identification test scores were correlated with Mini-Mental State scores, but geraniol detection was not. CONCLUSIONS: Odor identification is impaired early in Alzheimer's disease and may be more influenced by cognitive status than is acuity of odor detection, which is not altered until later in the disorder. The pattern of hyposmia in Alzheimer's disease suggests that the disorder may not \"begin in the nose,\" as has been theorized previously. Further refinement of olfactory testing may be useful in the diagnostic evaluation of early dementia."

    "abstract": "Learning disabilities in epilepsy: neurophysiological aspects. Subclinical generalized spike-wave discharges are often accompanied by transitory cognitive impairment, demonstrable by psychological testing during EEG recording. Transitory cognitive impairment is demonstrated most readily by difficult tasks and during generalized regular spike-wave bursts lasting for more than 3 s, but can also be found during briefer and even focal discharges. That this is not simply a consequence of global inattention is shown by the fact that focal discharges exhibit some specificity: left-sided focal spiking is more likely to produce errors on verbal tasks, for instance, whereas right-sided discharges are more often accompanied by impairment in handling nonverbal material. Both learning difficulties in general and specific abnormal patterns of cognitive functioning are well documented in children with epilepsy and are most pronounced in those with frequent interictal discharges. However, there is now evidence that intermittent cognitive impairment due to the discharges themselves contributes significantly to such neurophysiological abnormalities. The significance of transitory cognitive impairment accompanying subclinical EEG discharges for everyday functioning is uncertain, but there is experimental evidence that subclinical discharges may be accompanied by disruption of educational skills in children or by impairment of driving performance in motorists. In some individuals, suppression of discharges by antiepileptic drugs has demonstrably improved psychological function, but further work is required to determine the indications for such treatment."

In this prospective, randomized, open trial, 33 patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis were assigned to a 10-day treatment with either ceftriaxone, 2 g intravenously (iv) every 24 h (n = 17), or cefotaxime, 2 g iv every 8 h (n = 16). Of the 33 patients, 30 were eligible for analysis of therapeutic efficacy. Neurologic symptoms improved or even subsided in 14 patients of the cefotaxime group and in 12 patients of the ceftriaxone group during the treatment period. At follow-up examinations after a mean of 8.1 months, 17 of 27 patients examined were clinically asymptomatic. In one patient Borrelia burgdorferi was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 7.5 months after ceftriaxone therapy. CSF antibiotic concentrations were above the MIC 90 level for B. burgdorferi in nearly all patients examined. Patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis may benefit from a 10-day treatment with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. However, as 10 patients were symptomatic at follow-up and borreliae persisted in the CSF of one patient, a prolongation of therapy may be necessary."

Gilles de la Tourette syndrome has an important genetic component; the pathophysiology of this disorder may involve the dopamine system. We tested a D2-dopamine receptor (locus DRD2, recognized by probe hD2G1) for genetic linkage with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. Using a genetic linkage map of the region of DRD2 on the long arm of chromosome 11 and restriction fragment length polymorphism data from a total of four markers (DRD2 itself, D11S84, D11S29, and PBGD), we were able to exclude linkage of this candidate gene and Gilles de la Tourette syndrome in two extended kindreds segregating for Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. This rules out causation of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome by mutation in DRD2 in the kindreds studied under the genetic assumptions we employed; use of the map and multipoint linkage analyses also allowed us to exclude a Gilles de la Tourette syndrome susceptibility locus from a larger genetic region."

    "abstract": "Genetic flanking markers refine diagnostic criteria and provide insights into the genetics of Von Hippel Lindau disease. Von Hippel Lindau disease (VHL) is a hereditary syndrome, associated with tumors and cysts in multiple organ systems, whose expression and age of onset are highly variable. The availability of a genetic test for the early and reliable detection of individuals carrying the defective gene would be beneficial for VHL patients and their relatives, since many of the manifestations of VHL can be successfully treated if detected in their early stages, while the complications of undetected disease can be devastating. We have previously shown that the VHL gene maps to chromosome 3p. To provide genetic markers for the development of a reliable diagnostic test, and to further narrow and eventually clone the VHL defect, we have generated DNA markers for chromosome 3p. With these markers, we have performed a multipoint genetic linkage analysis in 28 VHL pedigrees, comprising 470 individuals, 164 of whom were affected with VHL. Here we report the identification of tightly linked markers, including flanking markers that bracket the VHL gene to a small region on chromosome 3p25-p26. This finding has several major implications. While visceral cysts of the kidney, pancreas, and epididymis are commonly found in VHL and are considered diagnostic criteria for this disorder, they also occur in the general population. The presence of cysts, unaccompanied by other more typical lesions such as retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastoma, may therefore represent a major diagnostic problem, leading to errors in the assessment of disease status. The application of flanking markers for the VHL gene for presymptomatic diagnostic testing confirms that epididymal cysts are indeed not suitable as a diagnostic criterion in this disorder. Pheochromocytomas occur nonuniformly in VHL families and may also be associated with other hereditary tumor syndromes; our genetic studies imply that the phenotype in VHL families with and without pheochromocytomas is caused by defects within the same gene. The absence or presence of this tumor type is therefore due to the pleiotropic expression of a single gene rather than to the existence of several different genes for VHL. The region on chromosome 3p13-p14 known to contain several chromosomal translocation breakpoints in families with \"pure familial renal cell carcinoma\" is quite proximal to the VHL locus in 3p25-p26 we have identified. Chromosome 3p may therefore contain two loci for renal cell carcinoma: one gene (or genes) in 3p13-p14 and the VHL gene in 3p25-p26, whose aberration is also associated with other typical manifestations of VHL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)."

A rehabilitation program for a patient with a neuromuscular disease can be developed only after an accurate diagnosis has been established. The diagnosis and its ramifications should suggest a natural course of disease which, it is hoped, can be improved upon with a rational and realistic program. The program is best developed by an interdisciplinary team, including a pediatric neurologist, who should have the greatest understanding of the patient's problem and should ultimately be responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the program. A child with cerebral palsy commonly requires the services of physical and occupational therapists as well as knowledgeable orthopedists. Is the program appropriate? Does it consider the child's potential as well as his limitations? A child with a traumatic brain injury requires, in addition to the above, psychological intervention and an intensive educational program.

In order to test the hypothesis that the cerebral arteriovenous oxygen difference (AVDO2) and venous oxygen content (VO2) could be used to monitor brain energy metabolism in the setting of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). 12 cats were studied with 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy. six cats were subjected to intracranial hypertension by cisternal infusion of saline. Energy failure occurred at an average AVDO2 of 8.4 +/- 3.2 vol% (+/- standard deviation) (range 4.7 to 14.7 vol%). The VO2 at the point of metabolic failure averaged 1.45 +/- 0.6 vol% and extended over a narrower range (1.0 to 2.9 vol%). In an additional six cats, ICP was raised to the threshold of metabolic failure and hyperventilation was then instituted (pCO2 10 to 18 torr). Five of the six cats experienced a drop in VO2 with hyperventilation. In two of these animals, hyperventilation resulted in a VO2 of 1.1 vol% or less and in metabolic failure as evidenced by a fall in phosphocreatine. It is concluded that a VO2 of less than 2 vol% is correlated with brain ischemia and that the safety of hyperventilation in the setting of increased ICP can be monitored by the use of VO2."

    "abstract": "Hyperhomocysteinemia: an independent risk factor for vascular disease. BACKGROUND. Hyperhomocysteinemia arising from impaired methionine metabolism, probably usually due to a deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase, is associated with premature cerebral, peripheral, and possibly coronary vascular disease. Both the strength of this association and its independence of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease are uncertain. We studied the extent to which the association could be explained by heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. METHODS. We first established a diagnostic criterion for hyperhomocysteinemia by comparing peak serum levels of homocysteine after a standard methionine-loading test in 25 obligate heterozygotes with respect to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (whose children were known to be homozygous for homocystinuria due to this enzyme defect) with the levels in 27 unrelated age- and sex-matched normal subjects. A level of 24.0 mumol per liter or more was 92 percent sensitive and 100 percent specific in distinguishing the two groups. The peak serum homocysteine levels in these normal subjects were then compared with those in 123 patients whose vascular disease had been diagnosed before they were 55 years of age. RESULTS. Hyperhomocysteinemia was detected in 16 of 38 patients with cerebrovascular disease (42 percent), 7 of 25 with peripheral vascular disease (28 percent), and 18 of 60 with coronary vascular disease (30 percent), but in none of the 27 normal subjects. After adjustment for the effects of conventional risk factors, the lower 95 percent confidence limit for the odds ratio for vascular disease among the patients with hyperhomocysteinemia, as compared with the normal subjects, was 3.2. The geometric-mean peak serum homocysteine level was 1.33 times higher in the patients with vascular disease than in the normal subjects (P = 0.002). The presence of cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency was confirmed in 18 of 23 patients with vascular disease who had hyperhomocysteinemia. CONCLUSIONS. Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for vascular disease, including coronary disease, and in most instances is probably due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency."

Stroke in Asian and Pacific-Islander populations remains the principal cause of death among adults, but its incidence in the United States approximates that of Caucasians. Although controversial, uncontrolled hypertension in certain population groups (e.g., northern Japanese) and high dietary saturated fat in others (e.g, Pacific-Islanders) are believed to be responsible for the high stroke incidence rates. The recent reduction in stroke frequency rates in these areas is thought to be the result of better hypertension control. In the Ni-Hon-San Study, the level of hypertension and its frequency were similar in Hawaii and Japan, but ischemic infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage were less frequent in Hawaii. Reduced meat and fat intake may contribute to small vessel disease in Japan. Stroke is the third major cause of death among Hispanic-Americans and Native Americans, yet there is a paucity of information, especially about stroke, in subgroups of these populations. There is also considerable ignorance and controversy about risk factors for stroke in these populations. The need for additional research is urgent."

Intracranial, dural-based neoplasms will not infrequently invade adjacent venous sinuses. Therefore, the preoperative diagnosis of venous invasion is important, as it will alter the surgical approach to the lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive means of visualizing the cerebral venous sinuses. The preoperative diagnosis of venous thrombosis can, however, be difficult and confusing with conventional spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging because of variable appearances produced by blood clot degradation products as well as flowing blood. Phase magnetic resonance imaging is a simple method that can be acquired simultaneously with conventional spin-echo sequences, and is based primarily on whether protons are stationary or moving. In the context of venous sinus occlusion, phase imaging can demonstrate the presence or absence of blood flow more easily than spin-echo imaging. Three cases of dural-based neoplasms are presented that demonstrate the utility of phase imaging in diagnosing tumoral occlusion of the venous sinuses."

None of the methods (EEG; stump pressure) applied so far have been successful. Branston et al. (1974) found a threshold relationship between cortical cerebral blood flow and cortical somatosensory evoked potential (SEP). As the local blood flow fell below about 16 ml/100 g/min a progressive reduction occurred in the amplitude of the cortical evoked potential (N20/P25), implying a fundamental failure of neuronal function in the somatosensory cortex. We have monitored cortical SEP (somatosensory evoked potential) during 734 CEA's (carotid endarterectomies) in order to find an index of risk of incipient cerebral ischemia during carotid cross-clamping, to determine the need for shunting and the causes of early irreversible neurologic deficits. In 59 cases evaluation of SEP was not possible because of technical difficulties. During 586 CEA's no alteration of SEP occurred. However, 4 patients had an immediate postoperative neurologic deficit, while the SEP remained normal. Abnormal SEP occurred in 89 cases and in 6 of these an irreversible loss of SEP was seen. These patients awoke with a new neurologic deficit. We found a reversible abnormal SEP in 83 cases. Reversible changes of SEP occurred mainly during carotid clamping. The diagnostic sensitivity of intraoperative SEP monitoring in predicting neurologic outcome was 60% with a specificity of 100%."

The entry characteristics of 1367 patients enrolled into the Extracranial/Intracranial Bypass Study were examined to determine if site differences in intracranial and extracranial arterial lesions among racial groups could be explained by differences in risk factors. Blacks were more often hypertensive, diabetic, or cigarette smokers, while whites had higher systolic blood pressure and hemoglobin values. Orientals had the lowest prevalence of vascular risk factors. Despite these differences in risk factors, multivariate analysis showed race to be an independent and strong predictor of the location of cerebrovascular lesions. To our knowledge, this study is unique in documenting risk factors prospectively and systematically in three racial groups simultaneously. Although generalization is limited by possible biases related to patient selection, the results affirm previous tentative conclusions about the role of race in determining the location of cerebrovascular disease."

Fifteen controls and 25 cluster headache patients were studied. The patients were allocated into two groups according to cluster headache stage, i.e. cluster or remission period. During the tests, all the subjects were asked to inhale 12% oxygen (88% N2) for 30 min, and the decreasing oxygen saturation (SaO2%) was monitored. Patients in the remission period showed nearly the same decrement of SaO2% as controls. At the end of the test, patients in the bout showed significantly less reduction of SaO2% than the controls. In 5 patients, the test was carried out both in and outside the cluster periods. The tendency to less decrement in oxygen saturation in the cluster phase was as marked with this comparison, but the difference between the groups was not significant, probably partly due to the low number of tests carried out. Only one patient got a typical attack. It seems that hypoxia of this magnitude per se is not the cause of attacks. The different pattern with respect to SaO2% following 12% O2 inhalation in cluster headache may be due to an abnormality in central regulation and/or chemoreceptor sensitivity."

    "abstract": "Spinal cord inhibitory mechanisms in Parkinson's disease. We studied two spinal cord inhibitory mechanisms, recurrent (Renshaw) inhibition and reciprocal inhibition, in seven patients with asymmetric Parkinson's disease in order to determine their contribution to the pathogenesis of rigidity. Recurrent inhibition, studied in the leg, did not differ from that found in normal subjects. All three periods of reciprocal inhibition, studied in the forearm, were present but reduced in magnitude compared with those observed in normal subjects. The arms, whether more symptomatic or less symptomatic, gave similar results. The diminution of all three periods of reciprocal inhibition is similar to the findings in patients with dystonia and is apparently indicative of an abnormal supraspinal influence on spinal mechanisms in these two disorders of basal ganglia function."

In a double-blind, double-dummy study, the efficacy of topical 5% EMLA cream was compared with that of lignocaine infiltration in alleviating the pain of arterial cannulation. Forty unpremedicated adults were allocated randomly to four groups to receive EMLA cream alone, EMLA and 0.9% saline infiltration, EMLA and 1% lignocaine infiltration or placebo cream and 1% lignocaine infiltration. Following arterial cannulation, pain was assessed by the patient using a visual analogue score and by an independent observer using a four-category verbal rating score. Significantly lower pain scores were observed in all patients receiving EMLA compared with those receiving placebo cream and lignocaine infiltration by both patient (P less than 0.01) and observer (P less than 0.001) assessments. There were no significant differences between the three EMLA groups."

    "abstract": "Coronary bypass surgery: is the operation different today? Patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting have undergone an evolution in recent years. To document this change, we analyzed two groups of patients in 1981 (n = 1586) and 1987 (n = 1513) to document preoperative and postoperative variables important in determining immediate morbidity and mortality after isolated coronary bypass. Between 1981 and 1987, patients were found to be older (greater than or equal to 70 years, 8.7% versus 21.8%, p less than 0.0001), more often diabetic (15% versus 24%, p less than 0.0001), have a greater prevalence of triple vessel disease (14.5% versus 46.1%, p less than 0.0001), and have more left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 0.60 +/- 14 versus 0.54 +/- 13, p less than 0.0001). To facilitate analysis and because of overlap between subgroups, we subdivided patients into three subgroups for statistical comparison of the years 1981 and 1987: subgroup I, no prior procedure (n = 1546 in 1981 and 1396 in 1987); subgroup II, optimal group (n = 503 in 1981 and 292 in 1987, and defined as no prior procedure, ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.50 and age less than 65 years); subgroup III, patients having reoperations (n = 40 in 1981 and 117 in 1987). Internal mammary artery grafting was infrequently used in 1981 but was used in 72.1% in 1987. Major postoperative morbidity between the 2 years for the total population increased significantly: need for intraaortic balloon pumping, 1.4% versus 4.7%, p less than 0.0001; myocardial infarction 3.5% versus 5.5%, p less than 0.008; stroke, 1.4% versus 2.8%, p less than 0.008; and wound infection, 1.0% versus 3.0%, p less than 0.001. Wound infection (all types) in 1987 was increased sevenfold in patients having a perioperative myocardial infarction (0.7% versus 5%, p less than 0.0001). For young patients with good left ventricular function (subgroup II), there was no increase in these morbid events between 1981 and 1987. Hospital mortality in the total population increased significantly between 1981 and 1987 from 1.2% to 3.1% (p less than 0.0002), respectively. It was lowest for the patients in optimal condition (subgroup II) in both years, 0.8% versus 1.1%, and highest for reoperative patients, 5.3% versus 4.3%. In 1981, 58% of patients (503/870) were in the optimal group compared with 35% (292/828) in 1987 (p less than 0.0001). The last six years have seen a progressive trend in surgically treating older, sicker patients who have more complex disease, with a significant reduction in the best candidate group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)."

    "abstract": "Local injection treatment of tennis elbow--hydrocortisone, triamcinolone and lignocaine compared. Corticosteroid injections are the mainstay of treating tennis elbow even though their effectiveness has not been well established by controlled studies. A survey of consultant rheumatologists confirmed a widespread preference for this treatment but they varied in their choice of steroid dose and preparation. We examined the value of some practices by comparing local injections of 2 ml 1% lignocaine with either 10 mg triamcinolone or 25 mg hydrocortisone made up to 2 ml with 1% lignocaine (Study 1). The investigation was conducted double blind. Within the first 8 weeks, pain relief was greater for triamcinolone than hydrocortisone although the differences were not statistically significant. The response to both steroid preparations was significantly better than for lignocaine up to this point but at 24 weeks, the degrees of improvement were similar for all three groups and many patients still had pain. Relapse was common. In a separate but similarly designed study, triamcinolone 10 mg was compared with 20 mg of the same agent. Improvements of pain were similar and followed the same time scale. Post-injection worsening of pain occurred in approximately half of all steroid treated patients in both studies and this was sometimes severe and persistent. It was less frequent amongst those given lignocaine alone. Skin atrophy was reported in all groups but was more frequent amongst those given triamcinolone in Study 1. In conclusion, more rapid relief of symptoms was achieved with 10 mg triamcinolone than with 25 mg hydrocortisone or lignocaine alone and there was less needed to repeat injections. Results obtained with 20 mg triamcinolone were similar to those of the smaller dose."

OBJECTIVES--To test how the results of magnetic resonance imaging influence clinicians' diagnoses and management plans for patients with cranial and spinal problems and to assess changes in the quality of life of these patients. DESIGN--Survey of patients undergoing cranial and spinal magnetic resonance imaging with questionnaires about diagnoses and intended management plans before and after imaging and quality of life questionnaires at the time of imaging and again four months later. SETTING--Regional magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy unit. SUBJECTS--100 consecutive patients referred for cranial imaging in early 1989; 100 similar patients referred for spinal imaging. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Changes in clinicians' leading diagnoses after magnetic resonance imaging and their confidence in these diagnoses; changes in intended management plans; assessment of the contribution to the future management of the patient; changes in patients' quality of life. RESULTS--Magnetic resonance imaging altered the clinicians' leading diagnoses in 35 of 169 (21%) cases. The clinicians became more confident about their leading diagnoses in 90 of 167 (54%). There was a change in management plan in 113 of 182 (62%). The clinicians considered that magnetic resonance imaging made an important contribution to management in 119 of 162 (73%) patients. Overall, the patients' quality of life was unchanged at the four month assessment. CONCLUSIONS--Magnetic resonance imaging of patients with cranial and spinal problems influences clinicians' diagnoses and management plans, but the quality of life of these patients remains unchanged."

To determine whether populations with high cumulative incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) experienced increased deaths from sepsis, central nervous system abscess, or endocarditis, New Jersey AIDS patients were grouped according to their age, sex, race, and residence-specific cumulative incidence of AIDS since the onset of the AIDS epidemic. Between 1980 and 1986, among 25-44 year olds in the highest cumulative incidence group for AIDS, sepsis mortality increased from 3.3 to 15.2 deaths/100,000/year, an increase of 11.9 deaths/100,000/year (95% confidence interval (6.9, 17.0) deaths/100,000/year); mortality from central nervous system abscesses increased from zero to 1.7 (0.1, 3.2) deaths/100,000/year; and mortality from endocarditis increased from 0.8 deaths/100,000/year to 2.4 deaths/100,000/year, an increase of 1.6 (-0.5, 3.7) deaths/100,000/year. Age-matched New Jersey patient populations with low cumulative incidence of AIDS did not sustain a similar increase. The HIV disease-associated increase in sepsis mortality among young populations represents a new component of the substantial increase in U.S. sepsis mortality that occurred over the last two decades, but was previously limited to older populations."

    "abstract": "Observations on the pathophysiology of Nelson's syndrome: a report of three cases. Nelson's syndrome is generally regarded as an unusual sequela of primary bilateral adrenalectomy when performed for Cushing's disease. It is classically defined by cutaneous hyperpigmentation, considerably elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, and an enlarged sella turcica. In this report, we present three cases initially treated by transsphenoidal sellar exploration for Cushing's disease. In two of these cases, remission of hypercortisolism did not occur after the initial pituitary exploration. A microadenomectomy was performed in one case and, in the other, no microadenoma was found. In both, Nelson's syndrome occurred after adrenalectomy. A second transsphenoidal operation and radiotherapy were required to control tumor growth. In another case, transsphenoidal adenomectomy of an ACTH-secreting tumor initially led to a remission of hypercortisolism for 4 years, but recurrent Cushing's disease necessitated adrenalectomy, and again Nelson's syndrome occurred. The documentation of a pre-existing ACTH-secreting basophilic pituitary microadenoma before adrenalectomy, as seen in two of our cases, has not been previously reported, and these observations of \"non-classical\" courses have major implications for the pathophysiology of Nelson's syndrome."

DESIGN--Case series. SETTING-Day centre for adults with mental handicap. SUBJECTS--A balanced sample of 75 of the 150 people attending the day centre. 10 Were excluded because consent was not given. RESULTS--The subjects did not consult their general practitioners more frequently than the general population but were more likely to be taking prescribed drugs, and 57% of these prescriptions had not been reviewed by a doctor. Thirty three people failed vision screening, including 13 who wore glasses. Twenty seven of the 62 who were testable had a hearing impairment. CONCLUSIONS--As only eight out of 65 people examined in the study did not have an appreciable problem brought to light, screening seems to be worth while.

We studied 106 day-care surgical patients (52 male) aged 18-70 yr (mean 49.6 yr) who received spinal anaesthesia with a 26-gauge spinal needle. The incidence of headache, back pain and patient acceptability were investigated after operation using a questionnaire. The incidence of postspinal headache was 7.5%, and 11.3% of patients developed back pain. One patient remained in hospital because of hypotension and dizziness. There were no major complications and patient acceptability was almost 100%. We conclude that spinal anaesthesia for day-care surgery is easy to perform and cost effective."

However, sequences of two or three memory-guided saccades were severely impaired in both patients.

    "abstract": "Volume conduction of the parietal N20 potential to the prerolandic frontal area. Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded from the frontal and parietal areas in patients with various lesions in the central nervous system on stimulation of the median nerve. Five representative cases who showed a selective loss of the positive potential from the frontal area are reported. In each case, the parietal N20 potential was relatively well preserved, and the midposition between the frontal and central areas (FC area) showed a negative potential following P14. The peak of this negative potential was synchronous with that of the parietal N20 potential. This negativity on the FC area is considered to be a volume conducted potential from the parietal N20 to the prerolandic frontal area. Such an anterior volume conduction of the parietal N20 would not be explained by the concept of a tangentially oriented dipole generated in the posterior bank of the central sulcus. Instead, for the generator of the parietal N20 potential, a radically oriented dipole generated mainly in the parietal area is postulated."

Localization of the mutant gene that causes myotonic muscular dystrophy (DM) to chromosome 19 enabled our predictive testing using linked DNA probes in 74 members of 12 families at risk. Individuals sought either diagnostic confirmation or exclusion with childbearing in mind, or requested prenatal diagnosis. Valuable information was provided for 11 of 12 families. Of 14 individuals at 50% risk, 12 learned they did not have DM, two learned they did (although presymptomatic), and prenatal diagnoses of affected fetuses were made in three families--all with high degrees of certainty. The future opportunity for prenatal diagnosis was provided for 3 other families. The potential health risks to an affected female and her affected or nonaffected fetus provide cogent reasons for physicians to inform DM families in their care about these important advances and opportunities to avert grave complications."

Over a 10-year period, 183 patients who were able to open their eyes spontaneously, were oriented to person, place, and time, and who obeyed commands when they were first seen at a hospital subsequently underwent operation for an acute intracranial hematoma. The hematoma was extradural in 54% of these patients. A history of altered consciousness or symptoms of headache and vomiting were present in 61% of the patients; 33% had a focal neurological deficit, and 43% had either focal deficit or signs of a basal skull fracture. A skull fracture was shown radiologically in 60% of patients, including 52% of those not clinically suspected of having an intracranial lesion. Six months after injury, 77% of the patients had made a moderate or good recovery. The possibility that a patient who has recently sustained a head injury might develop an acute intracranial hematoma can never be completely discounted, even when there are no abnormal clinical signs, and a skull x-ray retains a useful place in the investigation of selected patients with a minor head injury."

Of 590 stroke patients hospitalized from 1983 to 1986 at the Neurological Institute, cerebral infarction over age 39 years occurred in 135 whites, 177 blacks, and 82 Hispanics. Outcome after cerebral infarction differed by ethnicity. The 1-month mortality rate was similar in whites and blacks and least in Hispanics. Whites had a slightly greater risk of recurrent stroke or death than blacks or Hispanics until 6 months after infarction, when their risk stabilized, while the risk in blacks and Hispanics continued to rise for the entire year of follow-up. By 1 year, the rate of recurrent stroke or death was 34.8 +/- 4.2% in whites, 31.1 +/- 3.6% in blacks, and 21.4 +/- 4.8% in Hispanics (p = 0.04). Differences were found in the distribution of various stroke risk factors in the three ethnic groups. A Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that the ethnic differences in stroke risk factors and infarct subtype were responsible for the ethnic differences in outcome. An abnormal first electrocardiogram was a risk factor for stroke recurrence or death in all three ethnic groups, while a nonlacunar infarct subtype and a history of diabetes were significant only in Hispanics. Understanding the associations of stroke determinants with ethnicity may lead to more focused secondary prevention of recurrent stroke."

In this study the direct effects of glutamate and its metabolite, glutamine, on arterial contractility were examined using rings of rabbit aorta. In a high concentration glutamate caused significant concentration-dependent contractions (EC50, 10(-1)M; maximum tension, 188.4 +/- 33.3 mg wt tension/mg tissue). Agonists and antagonists for alpha-adrenergic, histaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, and GABA-nergic receptors as well as inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis failed to influence glutamate contractions. At high concentrations (10(-5)M) the calcium channel blocker, verapamil, inhibited the glutamate response. Glutamate and glutamine both exhibited concentration dependent relaxation of norepinephrine (NE), phenylephrine (PE), histamine, serotonin (5-HT), and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha)-induced contractions. Kainic acid (10(-4)M), an agonist of one subpopulation of central glutamate receptor, potentiated glutamate-induced vasoconstriction; a higher concentration (10(-3)M) produced an irreversible inhibition of glutamate contractility. Only the central glutamate receptor antagonist, ketamine (10(-4)-10(-2)M), induced a reversible, concentration dependent inhibition of glutamate-induced contractions. Glutamate contractility was not dependent on extracellular calcium, an intact endothelium or neuronal function. These results demonstrate a direct effect of glutamate on peripheral arterial tone. Dietary consumption of large quantities of MSG may represent a serious health hazard to certain individuals with pre-existing vascular disease."

    "abstract": "Enhanced in vitro uptake and retention of 3H-tetraphenylphosphonium by nervous system tumor cells. Photodynamic therapy is a promising treatment for human brain tumors because of the selective retention of certain compounds by tumor cells. Certain lipophilic cationic compounds, such as tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP), are selectively taken up by a variety of carcinomas. Although preferential retention of TPP has been demonstrated for the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7, this compound had not been tested previously on cells derived from nervous system tumors. In the present study, tritiated-TPP (3H-TPP) uptake and retention for eight different cell cultures of three histologically different types of nervous system tumors was measured and the data were compared to a positive control (MCF-7) and negative controls (normal African Green monkey kidney epithelium (CV-1) and the normal human fibroblast (WI-38) cell lines). Uptake and retention characteristics could be grouped by specific pathological tumor types, but individual tumor variability was notable. Malignant astrocytoma (grade III/III glioblastoma) and malignant neurofibrosarcoma cells showed preferential uptake and retention of 3H-TPP relative to meningioma cells and normal controls. A clonogenic assay utilizing the cytotoxic lipophilic cationic compound dequalinium showed strong retainers of 3H-TPP to be more susceptible to the effects of dequalinium than weak retainers. These data demonstrate that certain human and experimental animal nervous system tumor cell lines retain lipophilic compounds possessing a delocalized positive charge. Lipophilic cationic compounds may be useful in the intraoperative delineation of tumor margins and in the photodynamic therapy of certain nervous system tumors."

Improved access to lesions at the medial end of the sphenoid wing or in the interpeduncular cistern after mobilization of the zygoma has been a subject of growing interest in recent years. This study describes the operative technique we have adopted and records our experience with 55 operations in 54 patients who underwent the procedure in the past 3 years. Seven patients had vascular lesions, 44 had tumors, and 3 had miscellaneous lesions. The majority of the tumors were medial meningiomas, and particular note is made of those arising from the cavernous sinus with respect to their resectability. Sixteen of these tumors were encountered, and total excision was possible in 11 cases. Access to the infratemporal fossa is facilitated, and in 2 cases we were able to excise completely trigeminal neuromas that had extended there. The extra maneuver adds little to the overall operating time, and complications relating to it are uncommon, mild in degree, and usually self-limiting. We conclude that the operation is extremely valuable in appropriate circumstances."

Bovine testes acid alpha-glucosidase containing phosphorylated mannose residues was intravenously administered to mice and found to be taken up by heart (70% increase of activity) and skeletal muscle (43% increase); the major target organs. The uptake of nonphosphorylated human placenta acid alpha-glucosidase by heart and skeletal muscle appeared to be significantly less efficient, whereas uptake of dephosphorylated bovine testes enzyme was not detectable. The phosphorylated bovine testes acid alpha-glucosidase remained present in mouse skeletal muscle up to 9-15 d after administration, with a half-life of 2-4 d. Besides being measured in skeletal muscle and heart, uptake of phosphorylated bovine testes and nonphosphorylated human placenta acid alpha-glucosidase was measured in several other organs, but not in brain. The increase of acid alpha-glucosidase activity was highest in liver and spleen. We concluded that application of mannose 6-phosphate receptor-mediated enzyme replacement therapy may offer new perspectives for treatment of glycogenesis type II."

We report a case of acute oculogyric crisis due to prochlorperazine administration in a young black woman with a concomitant viral infection. Neuroleptic medications are the most common cause of drug-induced acute dystonic reactions such as oculogyric crisis. Prochlorperazine is an antiemetic agent with a phenothiazine-type chemical structure and is known to cause dystonic reactions. Drug-induced acute dystonic reactions are most common in young adults and in men. Viral infections may also predispose patients to these adverse reactions. Caution is warranted when this drug is used in patients who have other risk factors for an acute dystonic reaction."

In patients with acute liver failure and hepatic coma, an increase in the abnormal \"middle molecules\" seen on the chromatograms of the sera is suspected of playing an etiologic role in the coma. A pilot study of continuous hemofiltration using a high-performance membrane was conducted in 16 such patients in an attempt to decrease the serum levels of the middle molecules. The procedure was used alternately with plasma exchange. High-performance liquid chromatography showed a notable removal of the substances in the filtrates and a sequential removal from the serum by hemofiltration. Eight (50%) of the 16 patients had amelioration in level of consciousness and were weaned successfully from hemofiltration. Although only three of the 16 patients survived the acute illness, 13 others lived an average of 15 days and five patients survived greater than 3 wk. While the continuous removal of middle molecules from the serum may not reverse liver failure, this procedure used in conjunction with plasma exchange may provide a means of life support, e.g., for patients awaiting a liver transplant."

Focal, restricted subclinical seizures were noted in 23 patients, and 11 patients experienced auras that were accompanied by ictal EEG discharges. Auras and subclinical seizures usually were identical in EEG appearance, but were distributed differently among patients. The subclinical seizures and auras usually had the same origin as complex partial seizures, but did not always reliably indicate complex partial seizure origin. Subclinical seizures and auras were of favorable prognostic significance for patients undergoing temporal lobectomy. A majority (greater than 80%) of individuals with subclinical seizures and auras were free of complex partial seizures after surgery, whereas a minority (29%) of patients without subclinical seizures and auras became free of complex partial seizures."

An infant with Leigh disease, who was the younger sister of a similarly affected infant, had been examined before the onset of the disease. Ultrasonography revealed hyperechoic lesions in the putamen and caudate nucleus during the preclinical stage. At onset, these changes extended into the cerebral cortex and medulla. These lesions were also detected by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as areas of increased signal intensity. Her brother demonstrated the same ultrasonographic results; cranial computed tomography disclosed low-density areas in the basal ganglia which were detected as hyperechoic lesions by ultrasonography. These findings suggest that ultrasonography is useful in detecting early intracranial lesions in Leigh disease."

The functions of systemic mediators in migraine are not fully understood. It is unclear which mediators provoke this probably atopic disorder and which represent an attempt to correct an imbalance. However, it has been demonstrated fairly conclusively that increased histamine levels correlate with migraine attacks in susceptible persons. Recent studies showing that histamine seems to have many different receptors and to adopt different conformations for different receptors may serve as a useful guide to future scientific investigation. Further impetus may come from ongoing studies of H3 histamine receptors, which indicate that H3 agonists offer promise as prophylactic agents for people who suffer from vascular headaches."

Cell culture and biochemical techniques have been employed to examine the effects of steroids, bromocriptine, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the growth and proliferative potential of meningiomas. In cell culture, the growth of meningiomas was not altered by progestogens, antiprogestogens, or 17beta-estradiol. The progestogen, norethisterone, had no effect on the uptake by meningiomas cell cultures of 3H-thymidine. Furthermore, cytosolic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase activity of meningiomas did not correlate with the progesterone receptor status of the same tumors. In contrast, the androgen antagonists, cyproterone acetate and 11-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and the dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, all inhibited the in vitro growth of meningioma cells. The growth of meningioma cell cultures was stimulated by EGF, and there was a positive correlation between the EGF content and DNA polymerase activity in meningioma cytosols. These results demonstrate that female sex steroids do not influence growth of meningiomas in vitro, whereas antiandrogens and bromocriptine have an antiproliferative effect. Consequently, bromocriptine and antiandrogens may have a role in the medical treatment of meningiomas. In addition, these results suggest that EGF may be involved in the genesis and/or progression of meningiomas."

In a long-standing case of myxoedema with ataxia and dysarthria, neurophysiological investigations were carried out to assess how much of the ataxic dysbasic syndrome depended on the slowness of mechanical contraction and how much resulted from primary cerebellar involvement. It was observed that the Achilles reflexogram showed a marked prolongation of contraction and relaxation time and that in both quadriceps and triceps surae mechanical percussion induced a marked myxoedema and prolonged relaxation time. The EMG of these muscles during voluntary contraction and stopping reaction detected an excessive recruitment of the antagonistic muscles, starting without any abnormal delay, a finding at variance with a typical cerebellar pattern. Post-urographic analysis gave a pattern of oscillations still within the normal range. These findings suggest that the gait alterations of our patient depended on the increase in muscle contraction time and the consequent excessive recruitment of the antagonists."

Mean extraocular muscle diameters and the calculated muscle diameter index were significantly increased in all orbits with ophthalmopathy, particularly in those with optic neuropathy. Graves orbitopathy affected the superior muscle group (63.4%) more than the medial (61.3%) or inferior (57%) recti. The most common pattern of muscle involvement involved all five measured extraocular muscles. Solitary muscle involvement most frequently involved the superior muscle group (6.3%). Significant enlargements of the retrobulbar optic nerve sheath and superior ophthalmic vein were noted only in orbits with optic neuropathy. Anterior displacement of the lacrimal gland at CT correlated with clinical palpability and occurred more frequently in patients with optic neuropathy. Severe apical crowding was the most sensitive indication of optic neuropathy at CT."

Data from six surveys of systolic blood pressure conducted in Belgium between 1967 and 1986 were analyzed. The mean ages of the six groups of 3,328 subjects ranged from 70 to 81 years. The prevalence of systolic blood pressure levels above 159 mm Hg decreased between 1967 and 1986 from 51% to 21% in men and 66% to 22% in women; severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 220 mm Hg) nearly disappeared. During the same period, body mass index increased 1.1 kg/m2 in men and was unchanged in women; mean systolic blood pressure decreased from 159 to 142 mm Hg in men and from 171 to 147 mm Hg in women; the proportion of subjects receiving treatment for hypertension increased from 10% to 36% in men and from 18% to 41% in women; and the mean standardized 24-hour sodium excretion decreased from 265 to 188 mmol in men and from 208 to 160 mmol in women. Systolic blood pressure levels were significantly and independently related to sodium excretion in the 1967 and 1972 studies. The decrease in systolic blood pressure in Belgium was influenced by the combined effects of more and better treatment for hypertension and a decrease in sodium intake."

In a previous study, allodynia to cold and vibratory stimuli was found in the finger stumps of 24 patients with amputations, control values being obtained from fingers of the intact contralateral hand. When treated with regional intravenous guanethidine block (RGB), some of the patients only had short-lasting relief of symptoms, whereas others experienced a more long-lasting beneficial effect. In the present long-term follow-up study the patients were re-examined 6 years after the RGB treatment. The aim was to investigate whether the earlier symptoms and signs persisted, and whether there were any differences in these respects, between patients with long-lasting (group 1) and short-lasting relief of symptoms after RGB (group 2). All 24 patients were asked to answer a questionnaire concerning their clinical symptoms. In addition, 14 of them visited the laboratory for determination of thermal and vibration-induced pain thresholds. Comparisons were made with values obtained at the first examination before RGB treatment and with values from 14 healthy subjects tested in a similar way on 2 occasions with an interval of 8 years. Twenty of 23 patients reported that cold exposure still evoked stump pain. However, the threshold measurements showed that with time the patients had become more tolerant to thermal stimuli not only in the injured but also in the uninjured hand. A rise in pain threshold was also observed when vibration-induced pain was tested in the injured hand. There was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2. Similar changes in pain thresholds with time were not observed in the group of healthy control subjects."

It is accepted that the neck-eye loop (cervico-ocular reflex, COR) is enhanced following loss of vestibular function and that this helps to restore gaze stability during head movements. In this paper we address the question of which structures and/or mechanisms may participate in such plastic enhancement by investigating the COR in 2 patients with absent vestibular function and reduced smooth pursuit-optokinetic eye movements (SP-OKN). The patients had multisystem atrophy involving the vestibular system and the cerebellum. The COR (elicited by angular motion of the trunk relative to the fixed head and angular motion of the head relative to the fixed trunk) was not enhanced in these 2 patients when compared with normal subjects, in contrast to previous findings in a group of patients with absent vestibular function alone. Measurements of slow phase eye movement velocity during SP-OKN stimuli and during combined COR-OKN stimulation (head oscillation relative to the stationary trunk in the light) showed identical values in these two conditions, which indicates that the neck-eye loop did not contribute to gaze stability during head movements. The absence of plastic enhancement of the COR in these patients may be secondary to interruption of SP-OKN pathways at various possible sites and/or to involvement of the vestibulocerebellum, which is known to mediate adaptive plasticity in the vestibulo-ocular reflex."

    "abstract": "Atelectasis affects the rate of arterial desaturation during obstructive apnea. Chronic hemodynamic disturbances are more profound in patients with obstructive sleep apnea when underlying lung disease with abnormal gas exchange (low arterial PO2) is present. Previous studies suggest that pulmonary gas exchange could influence the rate of fall of arterial oxygen saturation (dSaO2/dt) in obstructive sleep apnea. We postulated that abnormal gas exchange in the form of atelectasis would steepen dSaO2/dt and thereby lower nadir arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) for the same duration of apnea. Apneas were created by clamping an indwelling cuffed endotracheal tube at end expiration in eight spontaneously breathing adult baboons. Apneas of the same duration were then repeated during temporary endobronchial occlusion of one lobe of the lung. SaO2 and mixed venous O2 saturation were continuously monitored, and cardiac output was calculated. Worsening of pulmonary gas exchange during atelectasis was documented by an increase in calculated venous admixture from 10.5 +/- 0.8 to 25.0 +/- 0.7% (P less than 0.001). The dSaO2/dt was independent of apnea duration at 30, 45, and 60 s. During endobronchial occlusion, apnea dSaO2/dt increased 20%, and nadir SaO2 was significantly lower. Possible mechanisms for steepening of dSaO2/dt during atelectasis are discussed."

However, the emergency medicine literature places little emphasis on the particular risks in children younger than 2 years old with blunt head injury. These children have immature bone and unfused sutures that may increase risk of cranial injury and delayed complications. A case is presented to illustrate this point. Unlike severe head trauma, where evaluation is directed toward computed tomography, the literature continues to be controversial regarding the indications for skull radiographs and computed tomography in minor head trauma. The authors recommend a low threshold for radiographic imaging in blunt heat injuries in children younger than 2 years."

OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal was to evaluate the utility of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation assays in clinical research in psychoimmunology. METHOD: They examined 23 depressed patients and 23 matched comparison subjects with this assay. There were no significant differences between these groups. They then combined the results of this study with the results of their previous study of 20 depressed patients and 20 comparison subjects to examine possible determinants of lymphocyte proliferation in depression. RESULTS: Depressed patients with lower proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects had lower depression subscale, anergia subscale, and total scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale than did patients with higher proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects. This finding was unexpected and unexplained. Depressed patients with lower proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects also had fewer obsessions and compulsions and less psychomotor agitation according to the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia interview than did patients with higher proliferative responses than their matched comparison subjects. Stepwise discriminant analysis and cluster analysis contributed little further understanding of the determinants of in vitro lymphocyte proliferation of cells from depressed patients. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal studies using multiple serial determinations of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation are the minimal design needed to make this assay useful in further evaluating any immune system changes in depression."

The diversity of infectious agents capable of inducing meningitis and blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury suggests the potential for a common host mediator. The inflammatory polypeptides, IL-1 and TNF, were tested in an experimental rat model as candidate mediators for induction of meningitis and BBB injury. Intracisternal challenge of rIL-1 beta into rats induced neutrophil emigration into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and significantly increased BBB permeability to systemically administered 125I-BSA as early as 3 h later (P less than 0.05). This injury was reversible, dose dependent and significantly inhibited by prior induction of systemic neutropenia (via intraperitoneal cyclophosphamide) or preincubation of the rIL-1 beta inoculum (50 U) with an IgG monoclonal antibody to rIL-1 beta. Similar kinetics and reversibility of CSF inflammation and BSA permeability were observed using equivalent dose inocula of rIL-1 alpha. rTNF-alpha was less effective as an independent inducer of meningitis or BBB injury over an inoculum range of 10(1) U (0.0016 micrograms/kg)-10(6) U (160 micrograms/kg) when injected intracisternally, but inoculum combinations of low concentrations of rTNF alpha (10(3) U) and rIL-1 beta (0.0005-5.0 U) were synergistic in inducing both meningitis and BBB permeability to systemic 125I-BSA. These data suggest that in situ generation of interleukin-1 within CSF (with or without TNF) is capable of mediating both meningeal inflammation and BBB injury seen in various central nervous system infections."

A total of 100 white and 258 black individuals, recruited from two city hospital primary care geriatric clinics, were evaluated and subsequently followed longitudinally over a 2 1/2 year period in order to assess accurately the presence or absence of dementia. In the non-demented, total MMS scores and performance on each item of the MMS were analyzed, revealing that people with an 8th grade or less education consistently had significantly (P less than .01) worse results than the better educated (9th grade or better) on borough, attention items, recall of table and dog, copying, sentence writing, phrase repeating, and total score. Furthermore, a total of 25% of the lower education group had an MMS score in the 18-23 range, traditionally thought to suggest dementia. There were no consistently significant differences between blacks and whites of equal education. In the better educated groups, using a score of 23 or less to define dementia maximizes the sensitivity and specificity of using the MMS in this diagnosis at 93% and 100%, respectively.

Direct additions of acetaminophen (APAP), 3,5-dimethylacetaminophen, 3-hydroxyacetaminophen or 3-methoxyacetaminophen to the medium of cultured embryos each produced an increased incidence of morphologically similar, abnormally open anterior neuropores. Approximate concentrations required to produce an equal incidence were 0.5 mM, 1.0 mM, 0.1 mM and 0.75 mM, respectively. In contrast, 2.6-dimethylacetaminophen and N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine failed to produce elevated incidences of abnormal neurulation unaccompanied by marked growth retardation. However, with intra-amniotic microinjections, 3-hydroxyacetaminophen and N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine were roughly equipotent for eliciting abnormal neurulation, whereas 3-methoxyacetaminophen required greater than 30-fold higher concentrations. This suggests that N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine does not readily transit the visceral yolk sac and would likely not be a major factor in APAP-elicited neural tube abnormalities unless generated in target tissues. The differential effects produced by two dimethylated (2.6 and 3.5) APAP analogs further suggest that sulfhydryl oxidation is associated more closely than sulfhydryl conjugation with the neurulation defect. Intra-amniotic microinjections of large quantities (3500 ng) of 7-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (7-OH-AAF) or APAP failed to produce the specific neurulation defect. Microinjections of 7-OH-AAF into the exocoelomic cavity effected the characteristic abnormal neurulation. Conversion by conceptal homogenates of 7-OH-AAF was roughly 7- to 8-fold more rapid than conversion of APAP to respective catechol metabolites, and specific activities in yolk sac tissues were greater than those in the embryo. Rates of conceptal conversion to the quinoneimine were approximately 2- to 3-fold lower than catechol generation."

The multiply injured trauma patient presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge: that of discovering all injuries while simultaneously proceeding with resuscitation and maintaining life. Many factors involved in the initial resuscitation of the multiply injured patient, such as altered level of consciousness, hemodynamic instability, or inexperience and diagnostic oversight, may lead to missed injuries. Injuries may be missed at any stage of the management of the trauma patient, including intraoperatively, and may involve all regions of the body. Established protocols in the initial management of the multiply injured patient, such as the primary and secondary surveys of the Advanced Trauma Life Support Course, will minimize the chance of missing immediately life-threatening injuries in the emergency department. A careful intraoperative approach must be used in all patients, but especially in those with hemodynamic instability, so that all areas are examined for possible injury, rather than concentrating simply on what is known to be injured. Use of the tertiary survey, a careful re-examination of the multiply injured trauma patient, especially when he or she awakes, will help detect injuries missed during the initial evaluation. Injuries will be missed. Rather than dismissing these as occurrences that happen only to the inexperienced or incompetent, one should approach the multiply injured trauma patient with both special alertness and the humility necessary to search for diagnostic oversights. This approach will lead to early discovery of missed injuries and will minimize the consequences."

These results show that a peripheral visual signal activates retinotectal pathways to prime the oculomotor system and that these pathways can mediate orienting behavior in hemianopic humans."

    "abstract": "Platelet-activating factor. A putative mediator in central nervous system injury? Platelet-activating factor (1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine) is a potent lipid autacoid produced by many cell types. Platelet-activating factor is produced by cerebellar granule cells in culture and has been extracted from brain tissue. Multiple platelet-activating factor receptors have been demonstrated in brain tissue. Activation of platelet-activating factor receptors in transformed neuronal cell lines involved increases in intracellular calcium. Platelet-activating factor has potent actions on cerebral vessels and cerebral metabolism when administered in vivo, but may not have direct effects on brain microvessels. Excessive platelet-activating factor production in pathological states of the nervous system such as neurotrauma and stroke has been shown in only a few models (e.g., spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion or focal repercussion brain injury). In multiple studies using highly specific and potent platelet-activating factor antagonists, reversal or prevention of key consequences of brain injury such as hypoperfusion following ischemia, reperfusion and edema, inflammatory cell accumulation, neurologic/motor deficits, and neuronal salvage were demonstrated. This review provides and analyzes evidence in support of the role that platelet-activating factor might have in modulation of brain function and pathophysiological processes in brain ischemia and trauma."

    "abstract": "New approaches in the rehabilitation of the traumatic high level quadriplegic. The use of noninvasive alternatives to tracheostomy for ventilatory support have been described in the patient management of various neuromuscular disorders. The use of these techniques for patients with traumatic high level quadriplegia, however, is hampered by the resort to tracheostomy in the acute hospital setting. Twenty traumatic high level quadriplegic patients on intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) via tracheostomy with little or no ability for unassisted breathing were converted to noninvasive ventilatory support methods and had their tracheostomy sites closed. Four additional patients were ventilated by noninvasive methods without tracheostomy. These methods included the use of body ventilators and the noninvasive intermittent positive airway pressure alternatives of IPPV via the mouth, nose, or custom acrylic strapless oral-nasal interface (SONI). Overnight end-tidal pCO2 studies and monitoring of oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) were used to adjust ventilator volumes and to document effective ventilation during sleep. No significant complications have resulted from the use of these methods over a period of 45 patient-years. Elimination of the tracheostomy permitted significant free time by glossopharyngeal breathing for four patients, two of whom had no measurable vital capacity. We conclude that noninvasive ventilatory support alternatives can be effective and deserve further study in this patient population."

This randomized, double-blind, multi-centre study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatment for 4 weeks with codeine plus paracetamol versus paracetamol in relieving chronic pain due to osteoarthritis of the hip. A total of 158 outclinic patients entered the study. Eighty-three patients (mean age 66 years) were treated with codeine 60 mg plus paracetamol 1 g 3 times daily, and 75 patients (mean age 67 years) with paracetamol 1 g 3 times daily. Ibuprofen 400 mg was prescribed as rescue medication. Due to an unexpected high rate of adverse drug reactions, the study was closed before the planned 400 patients had entered. Over weeks 1-4, 87%, 64%, 61% and 52% of patients in the codeine plus paracetamol group, and 38%, 31%, 22% and 29% of patients in the paracetamol group had one or more adverse drug reactions. Significantly more patients in the codeine plus paracetamol group had adverse drug reactions in each of the 4 weeks. Nausea, dizziness, vomiting and constipation were predominant adverse reactions in the codeine plus paracetamol group. During the first week of treatment, 30 patients (36%) in the codeine plus paracetamol group and 9 (12%) in the paracetamol group dropped out. As evaluated from patients completing the first week of treatment, the pain intensity during that week compared to their baseline pain was significantly lower in the codeine plus paracetamol group than in the paracetamol group. Moreover, during the first week the paracetamol group received rescue medicine significantly more frequently. In conclusion, when evaluated after 7 days of treatment, the daily addition of codeine 180 mg to paracetamol 3 g significantly reduced the intensity of chronic pain due to osteoarthritis of the hip joint. However, several adverse drug reactions, mainly of the gastrointestinal tract, and the larger number of patients withdrawing from treatment means that the addition of such doses of codeine cannot be recommended for longer-term treatment of chronic pain in elderly patients."

From the earliest days of neurology, the classification of epileptic seizures into those generalized from the beginning and those with a definable localization in the cortex from the onset has added to knowledge about the function of the nervous system. Further elaboration of the classification of seizures into those localized to the six-layered isocortex and those whose elaboration involves regions of the brain involved with consciousness and memory has provided the basic focus for the burgeoning subspecialty of epilepsy surgery. It is increasingly apparent that the etiology of a seizure disorder is of at least equal or of greater significance than the nature of the seizures it spawns and is the product not only of localization in the nervous system but also of causative factors with implications reaching into areas of genetics, higher cortical function, and intelligence. The prognosis concerning the outcome of the epilepsy under consideration is based on all of these facets. This pathophysiological substratum, of which the seizure is only the presenting symptom, constitutes the epilepsy or epileptic syndrome on which the formulation of a rational treatment plan is based."

The aim of this study is to evaluate what factors influence the risk of occurrence of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with particular reference to the role of early or delayed introduction of levodopa therapy during the course of the disease. One hundred twenty-five consecutive newly diagnosed patients with PD started levodopa treatment at the time diagnosis and were followed for 2 to 10 years. During follow-up, 60 patients had wearing-off or early morning akinesia. We estimated the cumulative time-dependent risk of motor fluctuation occurrence through a multivariable analysis. The risk was lower for patients with tremor-predominant PD, for those with shorter disease duration prior to levodopa, and for those who were relatively older at levodopa initiation. Our results suggest that, as far as motor fluctuations are concerned, disease prognosis is not influenced by early levodopa treatment. These observation support the introduction of levodopa as soon as there is a subjective need for the patients to maintain their level of social and work performance."

Sixty-three first, second, or third-time repairs of one or more pseudarthroses were done in fifty-one patients who had had an arthrodesis for idiopathic scoliosis. Forty-five of the patients were female and six were male. The average age was 30.2 years. The indications for the sixty-three repairs were pain (twenty-five repairs), progression of the curve (sixteen), both pain and progression of the curve (twelve), and radiographic changes only (ten). Failure of the implant was identified before 27 per cent of the sixty-three procedures. The pseudarthroses were diagnosed an average of 2.8 years after the initial arthrodeses. Sixty-eight per cent of the defects were visible on plain radiographs preoperatively and 32 per cent were identified at operation. During the time between the original arthrodeses and the repairs of the pseudarthroses, the scolioses increased by a mean of 7 degrees and the kyphoses, by a mean of 10 degrees. Harrington distraction was the most commonly used instrumentation (twenty-six [41 per cent] of the sixty-three procedures), and autogenous iliac bone was the most commonly used material for the graft (thirty-three [52 per cent] of the procedures)."

    "abstract": "Axial loading injuries to the middle cervical spine segment. An analysis and classification of twenty-five cases. Injuries to the cervical spine at the C3-C4 level involving the bony elements, intervertebral disks, and ligamentous structures are rare. We present 25 cases of traumatic C3-C4 injuries sustained by young athletes and documented by the National Football Head and Neck Injury Registry. Review of the cases reveals that the response of energy inputs at the C3-C4 level differ from those involving the upper (C1-C2) and lower (C4-C5-C6-C7) cervical segments. Specifically, the C3-C4 lesions appear to be unique with regard to the infrequency of bony fracture, difficulty in effecting and maintaining reduction, and a more favorable recovery following early, aggressive treatment. In the majority of instances, injury at this level results from axial loading of the cervical spine. Lesions were distributed into specific categories: 1) acute intervertebral disc herniation (N = 4), 2) anterior subluxation of C3 on C4 (N = 4), 3) unilateral facet dislocation (N = 6), 4) bilateral facet dislocation (N = 7), and 5) fracture of vertebral body C4 (N = 4). Analysis of these 25 cases suggests that traumatic lesions of the cervical spine in general can be classified as involving the upper (C1-C2), middle (C3-C4), or lower (C4-C7) segments. This is based on our observations from this series that C3-C4 lesions 1) generally do not involve fracture of the bony elements; 2) acute intervertebral disc herniations are frequently associated with transient quadriplegia; 3) reduction of anterior subluxation of C3 on C4 is difficult to maintain; 4) reduction of unilateral facet dislocation is difficult to obtain by skeletal traction and is best managed by closed manipulation and reduction under general anesthesia; and 5) reduction of bilateral facet dislocation is difficult to obtain by skeletal traction and is best managed by open methods. The more favorable results observed in this series of immediate reduction of both unilateral and bilateral facet dislocations deserves emphasis. In two cases of unilateral facet dislocation reduced within 3 hours of injury and subsequently fused anteriorly, significant neurologic recovery occurred. The other four patients, two who underwent an open reduction and laminectomy and two treated closed with skeletal traction, remained quadriplegic. In the four instances of bilateral facet dislocation where reduction was achieved by either closed or open methods, although there was no neurologic recovery, all four patients survived their injuries. However, the three patients who were not successfully reduced died."

    "abstract": "Silent myocardial ischemia during rehabilitation for cerebrovascular disease. In asymptomatic patients the importance of silent ischemic ST-T wave changes on Holter monitoring is known to be a significant predictive variable for one-year mortality of postmyocardial infarction patients. This case report represents the uses of ambulatory ECG to detect ischemic ST changes in patients who have had recent strokes. The cases reported here of silent myocardiac ischemia in stroke patients reflect previous reports in which 70% of the ischemic episodes in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease are not associated with angina and in which approximately 10% to 15% of acute myocardial infarctions are silent. We now believe that the incidence of \"silent\" ischemia may be precipitated in poststroke patients during their rehabilitation program. This belief is supported by two main factors. First, a high level of personally relevant mental stress exists which activates the sympathoadrenal system, which may lead to myocardial ischemia. Second, some stroke patients become aphasic and are unable to communicate adequately even if they experience angina symptoms. We have found that poststroke, most patients could not undergo exercise treadmill testing secondary to a variety of factors: inability to coordinate limbs, poor endurance, inability to follow directions, and/or lack of attention. We now propose that 24-hour monitoring for ST-T wave changes poststroke should be considered as part of a vigorous investigation for myocardial ischemia during the rehabilitation of these patients because they have an increased risk of cardiac morbidity."

Ten diagnostic signs were established to differentiate between the patient groups. Although they were helpful in separating patients with infantile nystagmus from those with spasmus nutans, no difference was found between the patients with spasmus nutans with and without CNS lesions. This study indicates that eye and head movement recordings do not allow differentiation between benign spasmus nutans and spasmus nutans-like disease.

This study determined whether opiates alter vascular components of inflammation (hyperthermia, edema and plasma extravasation) in addition to the suppression of hyperalgesia. Rats were administered carrageenan into one hind paw and saline into the other hind paw, followed by i.p. injection of morphine (0.2-5.0 mg/kg) or saline at 60 min, and testing at 90 min after hind paw injections. Morphine produced a dose-dependent reduction in carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia (17-53%), hyperthermia (39-53%) and edema (24-36%). Morphine treatment did not alter the temperatures of the contralateral saline-injected paws, indicating that opiate suppression of hyperthermia was not confounded by alterations in systemic body temperature or blood flow. The opiate effects on inflammation were stereospecific since levorphanol (1 mg/kg), but not dextrorphan (1 mg/kg), suppressed carrageenan-evoked hyperalgesia, hyperthermia and edema. Pre-treatment with naltrexone (1.5 mg/kg) blocked the effects of a 5 mg/kg dose of morphine sulfate on hyperalgesia, hyperthermia and edema. In a separate study, i.v. injection of morphine sulfate (2 mg/kg) reduced plasma extravasation by 41% (P less than 0.01). Morphine administration resulted in significantly greater increases in paw withdrawal latencies in the inflamed (38-139%) than the contralateral, saline-treated paws (4-19%). The results indicate that opiates exert a moderate, though significant, reduction in the vascular signs of inflammation in addition to their reduction of hyperalgesia. The mechanisms for this vascular effect involve inhibition of both vasodilation (as indicated by a decrease in hyperthermia) and inhibition of vascular permeability. In addition, opiates exhibit enhanced antinociceptive effects in inflamed paws, even when compared to uninjured paws in the same animal."

Using an unbiased stereological technique, the total numbers of pigmented and non-pigmented neurons were estimated in the substantia nigra of seven patients with Parkinson's disease and seven control patients. Compared with the controls, in which the average total number of pigmented neurons was 550,000, the number of neurons was reduced by 66% in the patients. The average total number of non-pigmented neurons was 260,000 in controls and reduced by 24% in the patients. A significant correlation (r = 0.81) existed between the total numbers of pigmented and non-pigmented neurons in the controls, whereas a similar correlation (r = 0.72) in the patients fell just short of statistical significance. The stereological estimates made in this study are unbiased, in that they are independent of nerve cell size, section thickness and of dimensional changes in brain tissue induced by histological procedures. The stereological method is considerably more efficient than previous conventional methods."

A synthetic gene encoding the 210 N-terminal residues of the alpha-subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) of human skeletal muscle was cloned into an inducible expression plasmid to produce a fusion protein in high yield in Escherichia coli. Like native human AChR, the recombinant human alpha 1-210 protein induced AChR-binding, AChR-modulating, and AChR-blocking autoantibodies in rats when injected once intradermally as an emulsion in CFA, with Bordetella pertussis vaccine as supplementary adjuvant. The minimum dose of recombinant protein required to induce biochemical signs of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) with 100% incidence was 2.2 micrograms. With 6.6 to 22 micrograms, serum levels of autoantibodies were persistent, and clinically apparent EAMG lasted more than a month. Clinical, electrophysiological, and biochemical indices of EAMG induced by doses of 66 micrograms or more were more uniformly severe and persistent, with 33% fatality. Rats receiving a control extract of E. coli containing plasmid without the alpha 1-210 codon insert, with adjuvants, did not develop autoantibodies or signs of EAMG. This highly reproducible new model of EAMG induced by a recombinant human autoantigen should be valuable for testing Ag-specific immunotherapeutic strategies that might be applicable to treating acquired myasthenia gravis in humans."

Exserohilum species are one of the etiologic agents of phaeohyphomycosis, a constellation of entities caused by dematiaceous fungi. This class of fungal sinus infection has emerged only in the past decade; it occurs primarily in immunocompetent individuals and produces a tenacious, progressive pansinusitis. To our knowledge, this study describes the first case of multiple intracranial mucoceles secondary to E rostratum.

Fasting serum glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and fructosamine concentrations were determined in 304 consecutive subjects admitted with acute stroke, within 48 hours of ictus. Based on the medical history and these results, subjects were divided into known diabetics, newly diagnosed diabetics, subjects with stress hyperglycemia, and nondiabetics. The type of stroke was classified as lacunar infarct, cerebral infarct, or intracerebral hemorrhage, based on clinical examination by a neurologist and computed tomographic brain scan and/or autopsy. Immediate and 3-month outcomes were examined in relation to (1) fasting glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, and fructosamine levels by stroke subtypes, and (2) glucose tolerance categories by stroke subtypes. A high fasting glucose level was associated with an increased mortality, but this was observed only among patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. Patients with stress hyperglycemia, but not diabetics, had increased mortality. In spite of having similar glucose concentrations to those patients with stress hyperglycemia, diabetics did not have a worse outcome compared with nondiabetics. It is concluded that the association between glucose concentration and outcome is a reflection of stress relating to stroke severity, rather than a direct harmful effect of glucose on damaged neurons."

This study aimed to determine whether the decline of the analgesic effect of morphine with a continuous infusion or that after a single injection correlates with the changes in brain concentration of morphine. The analgesic effect of morphine and its brain and serum concentrations were determined with a continuous 8-h infusion at a constant rate and after a single subcutaneous injection of the agent. The analgesic effect was determined by measuring the threshold of motor response to noxious stimulation. Brain and serum concentrations of morphine were detected by radioimmunoassay with the use of 125I-labeled morphine. With the constant-rate (4 mg.kg-1.h-1, intravenous) morphine infusion, the peak of analgesia could not be maintained: the increase in the pain threshold at 2 h was 1,003 g and at 8h was 286 g (a decrease in analgesia by 72%, P less than 0.0002). At the same time, the brain morphine concentration tended to increase, to 278 ng/g at 2 h and 329 ng/g at 8 h. After the single morphine injection (6 mg/kg, subcutaneous), recovery from analgesia occurred at a much faster rate than did the decrease in morphine brain concentration; the decrease in pain threshold was 79% at 90 vs. 30 min after the injection (P less than 0.0001), and the corresponding decrease in brain concentration was 28% (NS). The absence of correlation between analgesia and morphine brain concentration both with the constant-rate morphine infusion and after the single injection suggests the development of acute tolerance, which is pharmacodynamic in nature."

A technically unsatisfactory end point (transition from the removed diseased plaque to normal distal intima) leading to an intimal flap of the external carotid artery has been identified as a source of perioperative stroke. The mechanism involves thrombus formation with retrograde propagation of the thrombus and subsequent embolization of the internal carotid artery. This report describes three cases illustrating this mechanism and methods of identification and correction. This mechanism of postoperative stroke adds further justification for the routine use of intraoperative surveillance studies to document the technical result of endarterectomy involving the internal and external carotid arteries.

On the basis of these findings, it is proposed that NMDA antagonists may be beneficial as adjunctive treatment in the therapy of Parkinson's disease. CPP locally injected into the subthalamic nucleus, entopeduncular nucleus--the rat homologue of the internal pallidal segment--or substantia nigra pars reticulata of monoamine-depleted rats stimulates locomotor activity and alleviates rigidity, whereas local microinjection of CPP into the neostriatum is ineffective. These results make it unlikely that the neostriatum is the site of the antiparkinsonian action of NMDA antagonists in monoamine-depleted rats, whereas the subthalamic nucleus, internal pallidal segment, and substantia nigra pars reticulata appear to be important for the effects of NMDA antagonists."

It has been suggested that brain acidosis may follow head trauma, and therapies aimed at correcting acidosis have been proposed. Direct measurements of intracellular pH, however, have thus far not been possible in clinical situations. We have studied the intracellular brain pH in 22 patients after head injury (mean Glasgow Coma Score 6.1). Patients were investigated by a combined approach of phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (overall examination time 50-75 min) at a mean time of 11 days after injury (36 hours to 24 days). 31P spectra were obtained in 11 patients on assisted ventilation and in 11 patients on spontaneous ventilation. These spectra were analyzed to yield the pH in the regions studied in all the patients. All pH values were in the normal or alkalotic range when compared with 6 age-matched normal controls. No differences were found between patients on assisted ventilation and patients on spontaneous ventilation. When analyzed as a group, the brain pH in the focal lesions appeared to increase in the first days, to reach a peak in the alkalotic range in the second week, and to return toward normal within 3 weeks from acute injury. Our results suggest that there is no evidence of posttraumatic intracellular brain acidosis in recent human head injury, and therefore, therapies aimed at alkalinizing brain cells need to be reconsidered."

The electrical and contractile properties of hand muscles in a selected population of quadriplegic subjects were studied intensively before and after EMG biofeedback. Spontaneously active motor units and units that could only be slowly and weakly activated were observed in these subjects, in addition to units that were voluntarily activated normally. This suggests a considerable overlap of surviving motor neurons to a single muscle that are below, near or above the level of a lesion. Despite the common occurrence of polyphasic potentials and other signs of neuromuscular reinnervation, the average twitch tension of single motor units in hand muscles of quadriplegic subjects was not significantly different from that in control subjects. Nor did it increase after biofeedback training that typically increased the peak surface EMG by a factor of 2-5 times. The percentage of spontaneously active units was also constant. The surface EMG may be increased during biofeedback by using higher firing rates in motor units that can already be activated, rather than by recruiting previously unavailable motor units."

    "abstract": "Modulation of the stretch reflex during volitional sinusoidal tracking in Parkinson's disease. Sinusoidal visually-guided wrist tracking, in normal and parkinsonian subjects, was perturbed by torque transients every 90 degrees throughout the movement. Long-latency stretch reflex and volitional EMG amplitude modulations were assessed as functions of the tracking phase. Reflex modulation during tracking, both in wrist flexor and extensor muscles, was found to differ significantly between parkinsonian and normal subjects. In the parkinsonian group, the abnormality consisted of an increased reflex activity during tracking phases in which the muscle was lengthening. At these phases the reflex generated torque is opposite in direction to the volitionally generated torque and the tracking movement. No differences in the unperturbed volitional EMG modulation were observed between groups for this error constrained tracking paradigm. Significant correlations were found between ratings of bradykinesia and the amount of abnormal reflex modulation in the wrist flexor. These data suggest that a component of bradykinesia results from a defective coordination of supraspinal reflex and volitional control systems."

    "abstract": "Is gastric acid responsible for the pain in patients with essential dyspepsia? The pathogenesis of symptoms in patients with essential dyspepsia is not known. Since treatment with H2-receptor antagonists has provided symptomatic relief in some reports, we carried out the present study to investigate whether gastric acid is responsible for symptoms in these patients. Fifty patients with essential dyspepsia and 25 healthy control subjects were studied. After an overnight fast, a nasogastric tube was passed and its tip positioned in the antrum under fluoroscopic control. Normal saline or 0.1 M hydrochloric acid was infused in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Eleven (22%) patients developed pain with acid infusion, but none with normal saline (p less than 0.005). In 10 of these 11 patients, pain recurred on rechallenge with acid infusion but was promptly relieved with infusion of 1 M sodium bicarbonate. None of the healthy controls developed pain on infusion of acid or saline. These observations suggest that acid has a definite role in the pathogenesis of symptoms in some patients with essential dyspepsia, although other factors may also be important."

    "abstract": "Long-term follow-up of patients operated on for recurrent carotid stenosis. We reviewed our experience with 29 operations for recurrent carotid stenosis in 27 patients who underwent both their primary carotid endarterectomy and their reoperations at our institution. These 27 patients represent 4% of the 667 patients who underwent primary carotid endarterectomies at our institution and who are included in our carotid follow-up registry. Reoperation was prompted by recurrent symptoms in 19/29 (65.5%) cases. Comparison of long-term stroke prevention in those patients who did (84% at 5 years, 78.6% at 10 years) and did not (90.3% at 5 years, 83.6% at 10 years) develop recurrent stenosis requiring reoperation revealed no statistically significant difference (p = 0.48) when measured from the time of primary operation. The perioperative stroke and death rates for reoperation (3.4% and 0%) were acceptable. We conclude that with our acceptably low perioperative stroke morbidity (3.4%), surgery for recurrent carotid stenosis in symptomatic patients or in asymptomatic patients with high-grade (greater than or equal to 75%) stenosis maintains the durable stroke prevention offered by primary carotid endarterectomy."

We have studied the pelvic floor musculature and its innervation in 14 of 24 (58 per cent) multiparous women who had been recruited into a study of the effect of childbirth on the pelvic floor as part of a prospective investigation that began in 1983. These 24 women had all delivered by the vaginal route without forceps assistance. Five of the 14 had developed clinical symptoms of stress incontinence 5 years later; two of them had had a further uncomplicated vaginal delivery during this time. There was manometric and neurophysiological evidence of weakness because of partial denervation of the pelvic floor striated sphincter musculature, with pudendal neuropathy, which was more marked in those women with incontinence. These findings provide direct evidence for the hypothesis that pudendal neuropathy due to vaginal delivery persists and may worsen with time."

The outcome 1 year after they had sustained a severe head injury was investigated in patients who were admitted to the neurosurgery service at one of four centers participating in the Traumatic Coma Data Bank (TCDB). Of 300 eligible survivors, the quality of recovery 1 year after injury was assessed by at least the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) in 263 patients (87%), whereas complete neuropsychological assessment was performed in 127 (42%) of the eligible survivors. The capacity of the patients to undergo neuropsychological testing 1 year after injury was a criterion of recovery as reflected by a significant relationship to neurological indices of acute injury and the GOS score at the time of hospital discharge. The neurobehavioral data at 1 year after injury were generally comparable across the four samples of patients and characterized by impairment of memory and slowed information processing. In contrast, language and visuospatial ability recovered to within the normal range. The lowest postresuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and pupillary reactivity were predictive of the 1-year GOS score and neuropsychological performance. The lowest GCS score was especially predictive of neuropsychological performance 1 year postinjury in patients who had at least one nonreactive pupil following resuscitation. Notwithstanding limitations related to the scope of the TCDB and attrition in follow-up material, the results indicate a characteristic pattern of neurobehavioral recovery from severe head injury and encourage the use of neurobehavioral outcome measurements in clinical trials to evaluate interventions for head-injured patients."

Five children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (epilepsy, acquired aphasia, and continuous spike-wave discharges during sleep), were treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), sleep-modifying drugs, and corticosteroids. The pharmacologic profiles differed from those observed in focal epilepsies, resembling instead those of certain generalized epilepsies, such as West or Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. Phenobarbital (PB), carbamazepine (CBZ), and phenytoin (PHT) were ineffective or worsened the EEG and neuropsychological symptoms, whereas valproate (VPA), ethosuximide (ESM), and benzodiazepines were partially or transiently efficacious. Dextroamphetamine produced a dramatic but transient improvement in waking and sleep EEG in one of two children; aphasia did not change. Corticosteroid treatment resulted in improved speech, suppression of seizures, and normalization of the EEG in three of three children. Our own experience and data from the literature suggest that corticosteroids should be given in high doses as soon as the diagnosis is firmly established and should be continued in maintenance dose for several months or years to avoid escape. Early diagnosis, before mutism or global deterioration develops, appears to be essential for effective therapy with minimal neuropsychological sequelae."

    "abstract": "The robustness of an empirically derived taxonomy of chronic pain patients. There is currently no classification system for chronic pain patients that has achieved consensus. The lack of a classification that is used consistently across settings has impaired advance of knowledge and treatment of chronic pain patients. Recently, an empirically derived multivariate classification system, the Multiaxial Assessment of Pain (MAP) patients, has been developed. In this paper, the generalizability of the MAP system was evaluated by contrasting the MAP classification of 3 common but diverse chronic pain syndromes, namely, low back pain, headache, and temporomandibular disorders. The results indicate that although the proportion of patients classified into the 3 subgroups of the MAP taxonomy differ, the profiles based on the pattern of interrelationship among the assessment scales were remarkably similar. These data suggest that the psychosocial and behavioral responses associated with chronic pain are common to diverse samples of pain patients despite differences in demographic characteristics and medical diagnosis. The implications of these results for research and clinical practice are discussed. The potential utility of a polydiagnostic approach using more traditional medically based classifications such as proposed by the IASP (Merskey, H., Pain, Suppl. 3 (1986) S1-S225) complemented by classification based on the MAP psychosocial-behaviorally based taxonomy are examined."

Motor tests were performed in 50 HIV-infected patients in all stages according to the current CDC classification, but without any clinically evident central nervous system deficit, and the results compared with an age-matched control group. Patients were excluded from the study if there was alcohol or drug abuse, fever and/or opportunistic cerebral infection. The parameters tested were postural tremor of the outstretched hands, most rapid voluntary alternating index finger movements (MRAM) and rise time of most rapid index finger extensions (MRC). Whereas tremor peak frequencies did not differ significantly in the patients and controls, MRAM and rise times of MRCs showed significant slowing in the patient group. Morphologically, the motor test performance of the HIV-infected patients was similar to that of patients with manifest basal ganglia disease (Parkinson's, Huntington's and Wilson's diseases). MRI scans of all patients were normal. It is concluded that in HIV-infected patients there is a very early subclinical central nervous system affection, especially of the basal ganglia, which is detectable with appropriate, quantitative motor function tests. These functional abnormalities precede the structural alterations in the MRI scans."

Flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content was performed in 26 adenoid cystic carcinomas of the submandibular gland using archived, paraffin-embedded tissues. The DNA content was compared with multiple histologic parameters and clinical course. Ten carcinomas (38%) were aneuploid and 16 (62%) diploid. Aneuploid carcinomas demonstrated a higher frequency of solid cytoarchitecture, lymph node metastases, and advanced clinical stage, as compared with diploid carcinomas. Other histologic features predicting aggressive clinical behavior also correlated with abnormal DNA content and included invasion of nerves larger than 0.25 mm and intravascular extension. Our data suggest that DNA content analysis can be an effective objective parameter in the clinicopathologic assessment of adenoid cystic carcinoma."

Difficulties in assessing and quantifying the biomedical signs and symptoms that may be related to patients' reports of pain are well recognized. Although there appears to be some consensus among physicians as to the potential utility of examination and diagnostic tests frequently used to evaluate chronic pain patients, little attention has been paid to the reliability of interpreting the results of these procedures. Moreover, the integration of biomedical findings to form a general index of pathology associated with chronic pain has been a difficult problem to solve because not all biomedical procedures used to evaluate pain patients are necessarily relevant or indicated for a specific patient. Two studies are presented that were designed to evaluate the reliability of 23 biomedical procedures commonly used to evaluate chronic pain patients and to determine if findings on these procedures can effectively be combined to form a reliable index of physical pathology. The results of study 1 suggest that 17 of the 23 procedures can be applied in clinical setting with acceptable levels of reliability. Study 2 provides evidence that an innovative weighted scoring approach, based on current medical consensus, can be used to produce a reliable, general index of pathology that is independent of the number of procedures used to evaluate patients. The utility of this quantification approach to biomedical findings for clinical and research purposes is discussed."

Some of the difficulties in interpreting the results of these behavioral studies are reviewed, and potential mechanisms of drug effects are discussed. These types of studies are leading to an increased awareness of the potentially harmful effects of some drugs often given to stroke patients.

Optimal management involves the identification and treatment of underlying mental disorders rather than symptomatic treatment alone. Organic mental disorders are very frequent in AIDS, particularly with seriously ill patients who are medical inpatients. There is a high priori probability that such common symptoms as agitation, irritability, and insomnia will be caused by an organic mental disorder.

Eighty-four patients with damage to various levels of the nervous system, ranging from the peripheral nerves to the cerebral cortex, underwent somesthetic assessment in order to determine the degree to which basic and complex perceptual and motor disorders affect tactile object recognition (TOR) and to determine whether TOR can be impaired in the absence of more basic sensorimotor imperception. The results suggest that (1) basic and intermediate disorders of somesthetic function impair TOR but are commensurately more severe for any given degree of TOR impairment in patients with peripheral lesions than in patients with cortical lesions; (2) neither hemiparesis nor hemianopia alone precludes normal TOR; (3) hemineglect contributes substantially to TOR impairment; (4) impairment of TOR can occur in the absence of more basic somesthetic dysfunction and constitutes tactile agnosia; (5) tactile agnosia is a subtle, nondisabling disorder that should be distinguished from the nonagnosic, severe and disabling disorder, astereognosis; and (6) tactile agnosia results from unilateral damage to parietotemporal cortices, possibly including the second somatosensory cortex, in either hemisphere."

In the acute phase, 5 patients (11.6%) died from respiratory and cardiovascular complications and 2 new strokes occurred, both in the posterior circulation. During follow-up, recurrent vertebrobasilar territory strokes occurred in only 2 patients (a rate of 1.9% per year). The mechanisms of stroke were vertebral artery (VA) branch occlusion, causing a medial medullary syndrome, and basilar artery thrombosis propagating from a contralateral, distal VA stenosis. In the acute phase of LMI, respiratory and cardiovascular events, presumably caused by autonomic dysfunction related to the lateral medullary lesion, are the major hazards. Recurrent posterior circulation strokes were uncommon during follow-up."

The potential structural similarity of technetium-99m-labeled glucaric acid (99mTc-glucarate) to that of fructose suggests that this agent may enter cells by a sugar transport system. Studies with LLC-PK1 cells demonstrated inhibition of 99mTc-glucarate uptake by fructose, confirming this potential relationship. Since anaerobic metabolism can use either glucose or fructose, we hypothesized that 99mTc-glucarate may concentrate in areas of acute ischemic injury. To test this hypothesis, 63 adult rats with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion followed by reperfusion were injected with 99mTc-glucarate and in vivo and ex vivo images were acquired. Seven animals were also studied with 18FDG and high resolution PET imaging. The radionuclide images were compared to the results of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and conventional histopathology. Thirty-five rats had significant accumulation of 99mTc-glucarate and no TTC staining (indicating infarction) in the involved hemisphere. Of the remaining 28 rats with TTC staining (suggesting viability) of the involved hemisphere, 16 (57%) had 99mTc-glucarate accumulation. In the seven rats that were studied with both 99mTc-glucarate and 18FDG, 99mTc-glucarate accumulated at the center of the occluded MCA territory while 18FDG activity was decreased in this region. These results suggest that 99mTc-glucarate is a sensitive marker of acute severe cerebral injury, but its mechanism of localization is probably different from that of 18FDG."

Twelve patients (41%) had abnormal Nielsen test results, and 11 patients (38%) had elevated levels of platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. There was a positive correlation between the percentage of change in finger systolic pressure on cooling (Nielsen test) and the number of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. There was poor correlation between Raynaud's syndrome symptoms and an abnormal Nielsen test result. Digital photoplethysmography showed a normal waveform in 2 of 3 patients. We hypothesize that a subgroup of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome have an up-regulation of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors as a cause of their exaggerated reaction to cold."

We have established linkage between the disease phenotype \"lubag\" and DNA markers which span the Xp11.22-Xq21.3 region by using a large Filipino family with 8 affected men in three generations. These DNA markers define an interval of about 20 centimorgans in the pericentromeric region of the X chromosome as the most likely site of the disease locus XDPD (X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism). XDPD has a maximum multipoint log likelihood ratio score (Zmax) of about 4.6 over the interval from Xq12 to Xq21.31 (DXS159-DXYS1X). The co-occurrence of dystonia and parkinsonism in lubag and in other known disorders suggests there may be a common pathogenetic mechanism. Identification of the genetic defect in this family may provide an important clue toward understanding the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of both dystonia and parkinsonism."

Fifty-five patients with severe pain from spinal instability secondary to metastatic cancer were referred to Hope Hospital, none being judged to be in a terminal condition.

Twenty-eight of the patients had clinical evidence of spinal cord or cauda equina compression and were decompressed at the time of stabilisation. Of these, 20 had major recovery of neurological function. Patients with pre-operative evidence of extradural tumour had 'prophylactic' decompression at the time of stabilisation; none of these patients later developed signs of cord or cauda equina compression. The results suggest that alleviation of pain and restoration of mobility are best achieved by segmental spinal stabilisation; a few patients require a combined anterior and posterior stabilisation.

To evaluate the clinical relevance of these losses, the results were also compared with those for two other patient groups with abnormal corneal optics, seven radial keratotomy patients and seven keratoconus patients wearing rigid contact lenses. Contrast thresholds for the epikeratoplasty and keratoconus patients were similar and usually statistically indistinguishable, and their losses were far more profound than those of the radial keratotomy patients. The addition of glare did not alter this pattern of losses. The results document the extent of vision losses in these patients and suggest that increased intraocular light scattering is not a major contributor to the observed contrast sensitivity decrements."

We examined the potential of x-irradiation, at clinical dose levels, to manipulate the cellular constituents and thereby change the consequences of transection injury to adult mammalian central nervous tissue (rat olfactory bulb). Irradiation resulted in reduction or elimination of reactive astrocytes at the site of incision provided that it was delivered within a defined time window postinjury. Under conditions optimal for the elimination of gliosis (15-18 days postinjury), irradiation of severed olfactory bulbs averted some of the degenerative consequences of lesion. We observed that irradiation was accompanied by prevention of tissue degeneration around the site of lesion, structural healing with maintenance of the typical cell lamination, and rescue of some axotomized mitral cells (principal bulb neurons). Thus radiation resulted in partial preservation of normal tissue morphology. It is postulated that intrusive cell populations are generated in response to injury and reactive astrocytes are one such group. Our results suggest that selective elimination of these cells by irradiation enabled some of the regenerative processes that are necessary for full recovery to maintain their courses. The cellular targets of these cells, their modes of intervention in recovery, and the potential role of irradiation as a therapeutic modality for injured central nervous system are discussed."

A randomized study was conducted to compare the effect on plasma AVP concentrations of giving maintenance fluid requirements plus replacement of any deficit versus restricting fluids to two thirds of maintenance requirements for 24 hours. Plasma AVP concentrations and serum osmolality were measured before fluid therapy was begun and again after 24 hours. Nineteen children, 2 months to 17 years of age, were studied; 13 had bacterial meningitis (12 with Haemophilus influenzae type b). Ten children (seven with bacterial meningitis) received a mean of 1.42 times the calculated maintenance fluid requirements, and nine (six with bacterial meningitis) were restricted to a mean of 0.65 times maintenance. Children in the maintenance group also received significantly more sodium (mean = 6.3 mEq/kg/24 hr) than children in the fluid-restricted group (mean = 2.0 mEq/kg/24 hr). The two groups were comparable for plasma AVP concentration and serum osmolality before fluid therapy was begun. The plasma AVP concentration was significantly lower after 24 hours of maintenance plus replacement fluids than after fluid restriction (p = 0.005), and the change in AVP concentration correlated with the amount of sodium given (p less than 0.02). This study supports the hypothesis that serum AVP concentrations are elevated in patients with meningitis because of hypovolemia and become normal when sufficient sodium is given to facilitate reabsorption of water by the proximal tubule of the kidney. Patients with meningitis can be given maintenance plus replacement fluids but should be monitored for the development of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone."

    "abstract": "Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders. Diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment. In this report, we discuss the definition, characteristics, pathophysiology, and treatment of tic disorders with a major emphasis on Tourette syndrome. Although the diagnosis of a tic disorder depends on the presence of motor and/or phonic tic(s), patients with these problems also have a variety of co-morbid features including obsessive-compulsive symptoms, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, behavioral difficulties, and learning disabilities. Conservative estimates for Tourette syndrome suggest a prevalence rate of 0.1-1.0 per 1000. This syndrome is inherited in a sex-influenced autosomal dominant pattern with either chronic multiple tic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder as alternative phenotypes of the putative gene. Current evidence continues to support a pathophysiologic mechanism involving synaptic neurotransmission, with the dopaminergic system as a primary candidate. Therapeutically, it is essential to clarify whether a patient's problems are related to tics or associated behavioral difficulties. Pharmacotherapy for motor and phonic tics is strictly symptomatic and should be reserved for those with functionally disabling symptoms. A comprehensive individualized treatment program is often required in the care of individuals with tic disorders."

    "abstract": "Relationship of clinical features with psychological status in primary fibromyalgia. Clinical features and psychological status determined by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) in 103 patients with primary fibromyalgia syndrome (PFS) were analyzed by univariate and multivariate techniques to determine if clinical features were related to psychological status or were intrinsic to PFS per se. The central features of PFS, e.g., number of pain sites, number of tender points, fatigue, and poor sleep, were independent of psychological status. However, discriminant analysis identified 4 variables--patient-reported depression, anxiety, stress, and pain severity--which together predicted 3 MMPI subgroups with an accuracy of 55% (P less than 0.001); the only musculoskeletal feature--pain severity--alone provided an accuracy of only 34% (P greater than 0.05). These data suggest a new concept, that the central features of fibromyalgia are independent of the psychological status and are more likely related to the PFS itself. However, pain severity may be influenced by psychological factors."

    "abstract": "Multilevel transneuronal degeneration after brain damage. Behavioral events and effects of anticonvulsant gamma-aminobutyric acid-related drugs. Recent morphologic and behavioral studies of the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid agents on transsynaptic degeneration after cortical and striatal damage are reviewed and discussed. Following unilateral lesions of the anteromedial cortex, mild atrophy appears in the ipsilateral striatum and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Long-term diazepam administration greatly enhances this degeneration, extends the degeneration into the thalamus, and severely disrupts recovery from somatosensory asymmetries. Following unilateral excitotoxic lesions of the striatum, progressive degeneration of neurons occurs in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and efferent targets in the thalamus. This degeneration can be prevented by chronic infusion of muscimol, a gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist. Unexpectedly, this treatment did not facilitate recovery from somatosensory asymmetries. Recovery in muscimol-treated animals was impaired relative to saline-treated controls. Thus, gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists either may enhance or prevent neural atrophy secondary to brain damage, but the behavioral outcome appears to depend importantly on the excitatory and inhibitory characteristics of the affected networks."

The patient's global evaluation was the most sensitive variable overall. Pain was more sensitive than Ritchie's index. Several variables may be omitted from clinical trials, especially if two active drugs are being compared. For example, the best maximum estimate for the difference in ESR between NSAIDs and placebo was 1.0 mm/hr (95% confidence interval -1.5 to 3.4 mm/hr), and for joint size 0.44% (-1.0 to 1.9%), corresponding to a quarter of a millimeter for each of the 10 joints usually measured. It is suggested to record only the patient's global evaluation, pain, and morning stiffness."

Occult congenital temporal lobe encephalocele has rarely been reported in association with medically intractable complex partial seizures. The four previously reported cases were unsuspected preoperatively. We present the case of an 18-year-old woman with intractable complex partial seizures since age 13. Seizure onset was electrically localized to the right temporal lobe. Preoperative neuroimaging studies revealed a middle fossa defect and inferior herniation of the right temporal lobe. Pathologic examination of the resected encephalocele revealed prominent features of meningoangiomatosis. We believe this to be the first case of temporal lobe encephalocele and epilepsy to be diagnosed preoperatively, and the first case also to be associated with meningoangiomatosis. The relevant literature on meningoangiomatosis and on temporal lobe encephalocele as a cause of epilepsy is reviewed."

Before the onset of choreoathetosis, varying degrees of neurological dysfunction were noted. Electroencephalography and neuroimaging failed to detect any responsible functional or structural changes. Six patients are alive 1 to 3 years postoperatively, and their condition is improving. Two patients died of aspiration or sepsis. All patients were grouped based on factors identified as being possibly causative: depth of hypothermia, cooling time, flow rate, and repeated hypothermia. The incidence of choreoathetosis was significantly different in group A (rectal temperature greater than 25 degrees C) compared with group B (rectal temperature less than or equal to 25 degrees C) (0/295 versus 8/463; p = 0.02). Based on cooling time, the incidence of choreoathetosis was significantly different in group B1 (cooling time less than 1 hour) compared with group B2 (cooling time greater than or equal to 1 hour) (1/220 versus 7/243; p = 0.05). Based on flow rate during cooling, group B2 was further divided into the low-flow group (less than 1,500 mL.min-1.m-2) and the high-flow group (greater than or equal to 1,500 mL.min-1.m-2). Although not significant, the incidence of choreoathetosis was higher in the high-flow group (6/153 versus 1/90; p = 0.22).

For many years, mechanical compression has been regarded as the sole cause for such pain. There are indications, however, that other factors, such as intraneural inflammation, may be of importance in this context. In this article, four cases are presented in which nerve root related pain gradually resolved without any proven change in the mechanical deformation of the involved nerve root. The data presented here suggest that mechanical compression, per se, may not always be the sole cause of radicular pain and dysfunction. These findings suggest that improvement is needed in our understanding of the pathophysiology of nerve root compression and inflammation."

Thirteen patients presented with varying degrees of neurologic impairment. All patients underwent spinal decompression; in 11 this was combined with an anterior fusion using autogenous tricortical iliac grafts. All patients have recovered and are ambulatory, and no patient's disorder was made worse by surgery. Twenty-three separate organisms were cultured, only five of which were Staphylococcus. The antibiotic courses were shorter and pain relief more rapid with anterior fusion. All anterior bone grafts incorporated rapidly, and there was no progression of kyphosis or sequestration of grafts, regardless of organisms or level. The rational treatment of adult spinal sepsis necessitates the securing of tissue from the spine for histologic and bacteriologic examination. Pain relief, stabilization, and neural decompression can best be achieved with anterior decompression and fusion. Autogenous iliac crest grafts incorporate in the presence of sepsis."

The stroke risk factors included in the profile are age, systolic blood pressure, the use of antihypertensive therapy, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, prior cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, cardiac failure, or intermittent claudication), atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular hypertrophy by electrocardiogram. Based on 472 stroke events occurring during 10 years' follow-up from biennial examinations 9 and 14, stroke probabilities were computed using the Cox proportional hazards model for each sex based on a point system. On the basis of the risk factors in the profile, which can be readily determined on routine physical examination in a physician's office, stroke risk can be estimated. An individual's risk can be related to the average risk of stroke for persons of the same age and sex. The information that one's risk of stroke is several times higher than average may provide the impetus for risk factor modification. It may also help to identify persons at substantially increased stroke risk resulting from borderline levels of multiple risk factors such as those with mild or borderline hypertension and facilitate multifactorial risk factor modification."

To determine the possible role of Wallerian degeneration secondary to the grey matter neuronal loss in the pathogenesis of \"leuko-araiosis\", computerised tomography (CT) of the brain was studied in 98 normotensive and non diabetic subjects free of cardiac diseases: 32 with Alzheimer's disease, 36 with Parkinson's disease, eight with progressive supranuclear palsy, and 22 controls. In Alzheimer's disease, leuko-araiosis scores were greater than in control subjects. Leuko-araiosis was more prominent in anterior periventricular areas in Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, and in posterior periventricular areas in Alzheimer's disease. In two patients with Alzheimer's disease and leuko-araiosis, necropsy revealed diffuse white matter pallor, mild fibrillary astrocytosis, and in one patient limited hyaline thickening of small white matter vessels, without any infarction or hypertensive change. Changes were more severe in white matter close to cortical areas with a great density of neurofibrillary tangles. Leuko-araiosis was more severe or more widespread in Alzheimer's disease than in Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and normal ageing. Differences in the location of leuko-araiosis between the four groups might be due to differences in the location of the grey matter disorder and Wallerian degeneration rather than amyloid in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and normal ageing. Wallerian degeneration might be another cause of leuko-araiosis in neuro-degenerative disorders beside previously reported extra-cerebral predisposing factors and amyloid angiopathy."

Change of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentrations in platelets from patients with chronic tension-type headache (TH) and controls were observed during cold pressor test (CPT). Before cold stimulation, 5-HT concentrations in platelets from patients with TH were significantly lower than those found in controls. One minute after the start of cold stimulation, 5-HT levels in platelets from patients with TH were significantly much lower than in the controls, as control levels rose and TH levels fell. The results show that, under stress, the absorbance of 5-HT into the platelets in patients with TH is reduced. It is suggested that, in patients with TH, there are abnormalities of 5-HT uptake into platelets and factors which cause release of 5-HT from platelets."

    "abstract": "Effect of emitted power on waveform intensity in transcranial Doppler This study assesses the problem of transcranial Doppler recording failure and seeks to determine the extent to which this can be ameliorated by increased emitted power. We hypothesized that waveform intensity is directly related to the rate and quality of successful recording and may be compared quantitatively among groups of patients. Among a large group of patients recorded at 800 mW/cm2 emitted power, intensity was strongest in white men, weakest in black women, and intermediate in black men and white women. It declined with age in women of either race, but not in men of either race. Analysis of the effect of emitted power on intensity predicted that significant numbers of waveforms recorded at 800 mW/cm2 could not be recorded at the current clinical standards of 100 mW/cm2, the difference being most pronounced in elderly black women. Temporal bone window thickness measured in a series of adult cadaver skulls was least in white men, greatest in black women, and intermediate in black men and white women. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that temporal bone window thickness is an important determinant of recording difficulty and suggest that increased emitted power can significantly increase successful recording, particularly in black and elderly patients. Increased power alone, however, cannot completely solve the recording problem within safe limits."

Relationships among two-month and final goal attainment scaling (GAS) scores, preadmission and final Portland Adaptability Inventory (PAI) scores, and work outcome for 16 graduates of a comprehensive, postacute brain injury rehabilitation program were examined. Final GAS scores were higher for program graduates who obtained the most desirable work outcomes, and preadmission and final PAI scores were lower for the successful program graduates. Final GAS scores were significantly correlated with other outcome measures. Preadmission PAI scores predicted work outcome, and two-month GAS scores predicted final GAS scores. Initial PAI scores distinguished between program successes and failures, but not between program successes and dropouts. A brief look at one case illustrates the modified application of GAS in postacute brain injury rehabilitation. Results of this study and case analyses support GAS as a quantifiable, individualized measure that is useful for (1) monitoring patient progress, (2) structuring team conferences, (3) ongoing rehabilitation planning and decision-making, (4) concise, relevant communication to family, referral sources, and funding sources, and (5) overall program evaluation when used in the context of other objective outcome measures.

Life events and difficulties were recorded for the year before stroke, using a standardised semi-structured interview, in 113 surviving patients seen after their first ever in a lifetime stroke. An age and sex-matched control group (n = 109) was also interviewed about the preceding year. The stroke patients reported fewer non-threatening events and events with only a short-term threat, while difficulties were reported with equal frequency by the two groups. However, events which were severely threatening in the long-term were significantly more common in the stroke patients (in the 52 weeks before stroke 26% versus 13%, odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.9). The increased rate was apparent throughout the year and not just in the weeks immediately before stroke onset. The number of stroke patients experiencing severe events in the follow up year fell to the level found in the control group. Recognised risk factors for stroke were found equally in those patients with and without severe events before onset, except that hypertension was rather less common in the patients who had experienced a severe event. It therefore appears that severe life events may be one of the determinants of stroke onset."

We present the first reported case of Candida pyelonephritis in a spinal cord injured patient.

A 50-year-old patient with C5 motor functional quadriplegia developed Candid albicans pyelonephritis while undergoing rehabilitation. The patient had several surgical procedures and multiple courses of antibiotic therapy during acute hospitalization. He continued to have a hectic fever curve, leukocytosis with increased band forms, lethargy, and progressive uremia during rehabilitation. Successful investigation of the patient's condition included assessment of serologic tests for Candida precipitin antigen; multiple blood and urine cultures; exclusion of other causes of hectic fever; abdominal computerized tomogram, which revealed a left kidney hypodensity with irregular margins; and a retrograde pyelogram, which demonstrated multiple renal pelvic-filling defects. Cystoscopically placed ureteral stents, which relieved the genitourinary obstruction, drained gross pus from which Candida albicans was cultured; the patient was treated with amphotericin B and showed clinical improvement. Pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of Candida pyelonephritis are reviewed."

Anginal perceptual threshold (the time from onset of 0.1 mV of ST segment depression to onset of angina during treadmill exercise) is prolonged in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease. In the present study, the functional significance of this perceptual abnormality was evaluated by analysis of its effect on exercise capacity and the severity of myocardial ischemia. Treadmill exercise in 32 diabetic patients and 36 nondiabetic control patients showed a close linear correlation between the time to onset of electrical ischemia (ST segment depression) and exercise capacity in both groups (r = 0.8 and 0.9, respectively; p less than 0.001). However, the slope of the relation was flatter in the diabetic group because prolongation of the anginal perceptual threshold permitted continued exercise as ischemia intensified. The anginal perceptual threshold itself showed a close linear correlation with exercise capacity in the diabetic group (r = 0.8, p less than 0.001), although in the nondiabetic group these variables were unrelated. The permissive effect of a prolonged anginal perceptual threshold on exercise capacity is undesirable as reflected by its correlation with ischemia at peak exercise (r = 0.6, p less than 0.001): the longer the threshold, the greater the exercise capacity and the more severe the ischemia. Indeed, the inverse relation between the severity of ischemia at peak exercise and exercise capacity in the nondiabetic group (r = 0.4, p less than 0.02) was completely lost in the diabetic group. Thus, in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease, anginal perceptual threshold is a major determinant of exercise capacity."

The clinical presentation correlated with age: infants under 1 year of age presented with macrocephaly, failure to thrive, and severe visual failure; children aged 1 to 5 years predominantly had precocious puberty with mild visual deficits; and older children (greater than 5 years old) had slowly progressive loss of vision. All three infants had biologically aggressive tumors in spite of low-grade histology, and died from progressive tumor growth. Eleven of the 13 children aged 1 year or over are alive and well, without clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression, 4 months to 4 1/2 years following surgery. Six of these patients, with a follow-up period of 10 months to 4 1/2 years (mean 27 months), have had no adjuvant therapy following radical surgical resection. The authors conclude that: 1) radical surgical resection of chiasmatic-hypothalamic tumors can be performed with minimal morbidity; 2) radical resection may delay the time to disease progression in older children and postpone the need for irradiation; 3) resection of postirradiation recurrent tumors may provide neurological improvement and long-lasting clinical remission; and 4) chiasmatic-hypothalamic tumors of infancy are aggressive neoplasms that require multimodality therapy."

A smaller number of sausagelike dilatations distended medium-sized arterioles. Two other patients had a small number of the same microvascular changes following proximal aortography. Thirty-four patients and 6 dogs not undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass had none. (A 35th patient who had not undergone cardiopulmonary bypass or aortography showed a small number of dilatations; mediastinal air was a suggested source.) Some of the dilatations exhibited various forms of birefringence. Because most of the dilatations appear empty, we speculate that they are the sites of gas bubbles or fat emboli that have been removed by the solvents used in processing. These microvascular events, occurring only in conjunction with major arterial interventions, may be the anatomical correlate of the neurological deficits or moderate to severe intellectual dysfunction seen in at least 24% of patients after cardiac surgical procedures assisted by cardiopulmonary bypass."

The innervation of the cranial vessels by the trigeminal nerve, the trigeminovascular system, has recently been the subject of study in view of its possible role in the mediation of some aspects of migraine. Since stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion in humans leads to facial pain and flushing and associated release of powerful neuropeptide vasodilator substances, their local release into the extracerebral circulation of humans was determined in patients who had either common or classic migraine. Venous blood was sampled from both the external jugular and cubital fossa ipsilateral to the side of headache. Plasma levels of neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide were determined using sensitive radioimmunoassays for each peptide, and values for the cubital fossa and external jugular and a control population were compared. A substantial elevation of the calcitonin gene-related peptide level in the external jugular but not the cubital fossa blood was seen in both classic and common migraine. The increase seen in classic migraine was greater than that seen with common migraine. The other peptides measured were unaltered. This finding may have importance in the pathophysiology of migraine."

The incidence of peripheral vascular complications in 272 patients with aortic dissection during a 25-year span was determined, as was outcome after a uniform, aggressive surgical approach directed at repair of the thoracic aorta. One hundred twenty-eight patients (47%) presented with acute type A dissection, 70 (26%) with chronic type A, 40 (15%) with acute type B, and 34 (12%) with chronic type B dissections. Eighty-five patients (31%) sustained one or more peripheral vascular complications: Seven (3%) had a stroke, nine (3%) had paraplegia, 66 (24%) sustained loss of a peripheral pulse, 22 (8%) had impaired renal perfusion, and 14 patients (5%) had compromised visceral perfusion. Following repair of the thoracic aorta, local peripheral vascular procedures were unnecessary in 92% of patients who presented with absence of a peripheral pulse. The operative mortality rate for all patients was 25% +/- 3% (68 of 272 patients). For the subsets of individuals with paraplegia, loss of renal perfusion, and compromised visceral perfusion, the operative mortality rates (+/- 70% confidence limits) were high: 44% +/- 17% (4 of 9 patients), 50% +/- 11% (11 of 22 patients), and 43% +/- 14% (6 of 14 patients), respectively. The mortality rates were lower for patients presenting with stroke (14% +/- 14% [1 of 7 patients]) or loss of peripheral pulse (27% +/- 6% [18 of 66 patients]). Multivariate analysis revealed that impaired renal perfusion was the only peripheral vascular complication that was a significant independent predictor of increased operative mortality risk (p = 0.024); earlier surgical referral (replacement of the appropriate section of the thoracic aorta) or more expeditious diagnosis followed by surgical renal artery revascularization after a thoracic procedure may represent the only way to improve outcome in this high-risk patient subset. Early, aggressive thoracic aortic repair (followed by aortic fenestration and/or abdominal exploration with or without direct visceral or renal vascular reconstruction when necessary) can save some patients with compromised visceral perfusion; however, once visceral infarction develops the prognosis is also poor. Increased awareness of these devastating complications of aortic dissection and the availability of better diagnostic tools today may improve the survival rate for these patients in the future. The initial surgical procedure should include repair of the thoracic aorta in most patients."

The diagnosis of sympathetically maintained pain (SMP) is typically established by assessment of pain relief during local anesthetic blockade of the sympathetic ganglia that innervate the painful body part. To determine if systemic alpha-adrenergic blockade with phentolamine can be used to diagnose SMP, we compared the effects on pain of local anesthetic sympathetic ganglion blocks (LASB) and phentolamine blocks (PhB) in 20 patients with chronic pain and hyperalgesia that were suspected to be sympathetically maintained. The blocks were done in random order on separate days. Patients rated the intensity of ongoing and stimulus-evoked pain every 5 min before, during, and after the LASB and PhB. Patients and the investigator assessing pain levels were blinded to the time of intravenous administration of phentolamine (total dose 25-35 mg). The pain relief achieved by LASB and PhB correlated closely (r = 0.84), and there was no significant difference in the maximum pain relief achieved with the two blocks (t = 0.19, P greater than 0.8). Nine patients experienced a greater than 50% relief of pain and hyperalgesia from both LASB and PhB and were considered to have a clinically significant component of SMP. We conclude that alpha-adrenergic blockade with intravenous phentolamine is a sensitive alternative test to identify patients with SMP."

This genetic abnormality was also observed in muscle of an unrelated infant with myopathy and in muscle and kidney of a fourth child with myopathy and nephropathy. Biochemistry, immunohistochemistry, and in situ hybridization showed that the depletion of mtDNA in muscle fibers was correlated with a respiratory chain defect and with lack of mitochondrially translated proteins.

    "abstract": "Chromosome 15 uniparental disomy is not frequent in Angelman syndrome. Genetic imprinting has been implicated in the etiology of two clinically distinct but cytogenetically indistinguishable disorders--Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). This hypothesis is derived from two lines of evidence. First, while the molecular extents of de novo cytogenetic deletions of chromosome 15q11q13 in AS and PWS patients are the same, the deletions originate from different parental chromosomes. In AS, the deletion occurs in the maternally inherited chromosome 15, while in PWS the deletion is found in the paternally inherited chromosome 15. The second line of evidence comes from the deletion of an abnormal parental contribution of 15q11q13 in PWS patients without a cytogenetic and molecular deletion. These patients have two maternal copies and no paternal copy of 15q11q13 (maternal uniparental disomy) instead of one copy from each parent. By qualitative hybridization with chromosome 15q11q13 specific DNA markers, we have now examined DNA samples from 10 AS patients (at least seven of which are familial cases) with no cytogenetic or molecular deletion of chromosome 15q11q13. Inheritance of one maternal copy and one paternal copy of 15q11q13 was observed in each family, suggesting that paternal uniparental disomy of 15q11q13 is not responsible for expression of the AS phenotype in these patients."

    "abstract": "Sumatriptan in acute migraine: pharmacology and review of world experience. The introduction of sumatriptan, a novel abortive antimigraine agent, has generated a significant amount of preclinical and clinical interest during the past few years. At the scientific level, sumatriptan is unique in terms of its selective pharmacological properties. The effects of sumatriptan in various experimental paradigms have led to new insights into the pathophysiology of migraine. At the clinical level, sumatriptan appears to be an effective abortive anti-migraine agent with minimal side effects. Its ability to decrease, rather than exacerbate, the nausea and vomiting of migraine appears to be an important advance in the treatment of migraine."

    "abstract": "Neuroacanthocytosis. A clinical, haematological and pathological study of 19 cases. Nineteen cases are described, including 12 cases from three different families and 7 nonfamilial cases, in which multisystem neurological disease was associated with acanthocytosis in peripheral blood and normal plasma lipoproteins. Mild acanthocytosis can easily be overlooked, and scanning electron microscopy may be helpful. Some neurologically asymptomatic relatives with significant acanthocytosis were identified during family screening, including some who were clinically affected. The mean age of onset was 32 (range 8-62) yrs and the clinical course was usually progressive but there was marked phenotypic variation. Cognitive impairment, psychiatric features and organic personality change occurred in over half the cases, and more than one-third had seizures. Orofaciolingual involuntary movements and pseudobulbar disturbance commonly caused dysphagia and dysarthria that was sometimes severe, but biting of the lips or tongue was rarely seen. Chorea was seen in almost all symptomatic cases but dystonia, tics, involuntary vocalizations and akinetic-rigid features also occurred. Two cases had no movement disorder at all. Computerized tomography often demonstrated cerebral atrophy. Caudate atrophy was seen less commonly, and nonspecific focal and symmetric signal abnormalities from the caudate or lentiform nuclei were seen by magnetic resonance imaging in 3 out of 4 cases. Depression or absence of tendon reflexes was noted in 13 cases and neurophysiological abnormalities often indicated an axonal neuropathy. Sural nerve biopsies from 3 cases showed evidence of a chronic axonal neuropathy with prominent regenerative activity, predominantly affecting the large diameter myelinated fibres. Serum creatine kinase activity was increased in 11 cases but without clinical evidence of a myopathy. Postmortem neuropathological examination in 1 case revealed extensive neuronal loss and gliosis affecting the corpus striatum, pallidum, and the substantia nigra, especially the pars reticulata. The cerebral cortex appeared spared and the spinal cord showed no evidence of anterior horn cell loss. Two examples of the McLeod phenotype, an X-linked abnormality of expression of Kell blood group antigens, were identified in a single family and included 1 female. The genetics of neuroacanthocytosis are unclear and probably heterogeneous, but the available pedigree data and the association with the McLeod phenotype suggest that there may be a locus for this disorder on the short arm of the X chromosome."

    "abstract": "Nerve growth factor prevents toxic neuropathy in mice. Taxol is a promising new antitumor drug with therapeutic use that is limited by a toxic sensory neuropathy. Taxol is also cytotoxic to dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro, but this effect is prevented by cotreatment with the trophic protein, nerve growth factor. We sought to develop an animal model and then to determine whether nerve growth factor can prevent taxol neuropathy in vivo. Administration of taxol to mice resulted in a profound sensory neuropathy characterized by decreases in dorsal root ganglion content of the peptide neurotransmitter, substance P, elevated threshold to thermally induced pain, and diminished amplitude of the compound action potential in the caudal nerve. Coadministration of nerve growth factor prevented all of these signs of neurotoxicity. These findings suggest that administration of nerve growth factor may prevent certain toxic sensory neuropathies."

The fiberoptic endoscope has never gained popularity among neurosurgeons although it is ideally suited for navigating within the cerebral ventricles. Recent advances in optics and miniaturization make the application of endoscopy in neurosurgery more practical. The authors report eight children who underwent ventriculoscopic fenestration of symptomatic loculated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collections. These CSF collections were either isolated ventricular cysts or trapped lateral ventricles secondary to obstruction at the foramen of Monro. Cyst wall dissection was carried out with a \"saline torch\" dissector which was introduced through a working channel in the ventriculoscope. The torch was used to coagulate vessels and to sculpt large windows in cyst walls or in the septum pellucidum. Ventriculoscope-guided cyst fenestration can be performed safely and easily under direct vision. The technique may permit simplification of shunt systems in some patients and elimination of shunts in others."

Nurse researchers have played a dominant role in all areas of pediatric pain relief and likely will continue to do so. There are currently a number of pediatric pain assessment instruments developed that are used in selected practice settings, but their use should be extended to document the existence of pediatric pain and its relief. Pharmacologic interventions for pediatric pain relief have been hampered by incorrect beliefs about analgesic risks, prescribing and administrating habits, and a virtual explosion of information in the area of analgesics. Although nurses have traditionally used nonpharmacologic interventions for pain relief, these methods have not been well researched. Continued research efforts in this important area will result in improved diagnosis and management of pediatric pain."

A study of cell surface phenotypes of PBL of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients showed that their T cells had a significantly higher percentage of 4B4+ T cells (the helper/inducer subset) than age- and sex-matched controls. The PBL of MG patients proliferated significantly higher than those of normal subjects (NS) in response to the purified alpha chain of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Anti-AChR antibody was present in sera of 88% of MG and none of the NS. The PBL B cells from MG only, when cultured with autologous T cells and stimulated with either pokeweed mitogen (69%), or AChR-alpha chain (38%), secreted antibody to AChR-alpha chain, whereas T and B cells alone secreted no antibody. T cells from PBL of MG patients were more readily cloned than T cells of NS, by limiting dilution, in the presence of recombinant IL-2 and in the absence of AChR-alpha chain. About 50% of T cell clones from MG patients, compared to none from NS, proliferated to AChR-alpha chain. This response was HLA-DR restricted. MG T cell clones did not display significant cytotoxic activity, as compared to control T cell clones. Our results indicate that in MG, 4B4+ regulatory T cells play their role in the pathogenesis of MG, not by cytotoxicity, but more likely by their ability to stimulate specific antibody production by B cells."

Delayed formation of a traumatic epidural hematoma may occur when the following are present: elevated intracranial pressure, hypovolemic shock, a concomitant mass lesion, coagulopathy, bleeding from dural or diploic veins, a dural sinus laceration, a traumatic pseudoaneurysm, or an arteriovenous fistula. Although criteria for computed tomography of patients with head injuries remain variable in the literature, delayed presentation of epidural bleeding must be considered in the differential diagnosis of posttraumatic headache irregardless of the time interval or neurological presentation."

Previous data on the consequences of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis for school-age children have been inconsistent, and much of the information on risk factors has been inconclusive. The present study was designed to evaluate the sequelae of this disease with a protocol for the comprehensive assessment of neuropsychological function. METHODS. Ninety-seven school-age children (mean age, 9.6 years), each of whom had a school-age sibling, were recruited from a survey of the medical records of 519 children treated for H. influenzae type b meningitis between 1972 and 1984 (at a mean age of 17 months) at the children's hospitals of Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal. Of the 97 children, 41 had had an acute neurologic complication. Sequelae were assessed by comparing the index children with their nearest siblings on the basis of standardized measures of cognitive, academic, and behavioral status. RESULTS. Only 14 children (14 percent) had persisting neurologic sequelae: sensorineural hearing loss in 11 (unilateral in 6 and bilateral in 5), seizure disorder in 2, and hemiplegia and mental retardation in 1. Although the total sample of index children scored slightly below the siblings in reading ability, the 56 children without acute-phase neurologic complications (58 percent) were indistinguishable from their siblings on all measures. The differences between the groups were small even for the 41 pairs in which the index child had had an acute neurologic complication (mean full-scale IQ, 102 for the index children vs. 109 for the siblings). Sequelae were also associated with lower socioeconomic status and a lower ratio of glucose in cerebrospinal fluid to that in blood at the time of the meningitis. Behavioral problems were more prominent in index boys than index girls and in those who were older at the time of testing, but sex and age were not related to cognitive or academic sequelae. CONCLUSIONS. We find a favorable prognosis for the majority of children who are treated for meningitis caused by H. influenzae type b."

Many biological and psychological possibilities have to be considered when attempting to explain cognitive dysfunction in the individual child with epilepsy. Electroencephalographic (EEG) information, which may be particularly relevant in some children, has mainly been studied in relation to the possible direct effects of seizure discharges on learning and behavior. Such discharges can be divided into transient, brief or prolonged. Prolonged seizure discharges includes nonconvulsive status epilepticus during wakefulness and status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep. In addition to the influence of seizure discharges, preliminary findings suggest that some children with epilepsy might have a subtle disorder of arousal mechanisms in sleep, possibly associated with impaired daytime performance."

A previously healthy 25-year-old woman suddenly developed right-sided facial numbness and a headache. The neurological examination was within normal limits with the exception of meningismus and right-sided facial sensory loss. A computed tomographic scan and a magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated an acute hematoma in the right cerebellopontine angle. A 4-vessel cerebral angiogram revealed no abnormalities. Posterior fossa exploration disclosed a large, partially thrombosed, fusiform anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm, which indented the pons at the trigeminal root entry zone. The aneurysm was excised, and the patient made an excellent recovery. She was left with a persistent trigeminal sensory deficit. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms are rare lesions that generally present with a cerebellopontine angle syndrome; occasionally, facial sensory loss is also a feature. Isolated trigeminal sensory findings, as illustrated in this case, are extremely unusual in posterior fossa vascular lesions."

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine whether music significantly reduces the pain and anxiety associated with laceration repair in the emergency department. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Adult patients presenting to the ED at an urban teaching hospital for laceration repair. Exclusion criteria included patients less than 18 years old, having received analgesics, with suspected alcohol or substance intoxication, and in whom laceration repair was complicated by treatment of a more serious medical condition. DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: This was a randomized, controlled trial. After giving informed consent, patients were randomly assigned to receive standard laceration repair without music (control) or standard laceration repair with music. Patients assigned to the music group chose an audio tape from 50 available styles and artists. Patients received the music through a headset, and they controlled the volume. Intradermal lidocaine was used in all patients. Data were collected on heart rate, blood pressure, and respirations just before and immediately after wound repair. Psychological variables included the state subscale of the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a visual analog pain scale rating, and a brief questionnaire. STAI and pain scale ratings were analyzed with Wilcoxon's rank-sum test with an alpha error of .05. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (19 per group) completed the protocol. Pain scores were significantly (P less than .05) lower in the music group (mean, 2.09) than in controls (mean, 3.31). Anxiety after the procedure was reduced in both groups, but STAI reduction scores were not significantly different between groups (music, 17.7; control, 18.5). Seventeen of 19 patients (89%) rated music \"very beneficial,\" and 100% said they would use music again. CONCLUSION: Music provides a safe, inexpensive, and effective adjunct for the management of pain in the ED but does not significantly affect anxiety."

DESIGN--Retrospective review of all deaths for 1986, 1987, and 1988 and prospective data for 1989. SETTING--A regional neurosurgical unit serving 2.7 million population. RESULTS--Of 553 deaths, 35% (191) patients died while on a ventilator and 17% (92) after discontinuation of ventilation. Medical contraindications to donation were found in 23% (32) of 141 patients tested for brain death, in 38% (19) of 50 patients who died while being ventilated who were not tested, and in 12% (11) of 92 patients no longer being ventilated. Consent for donation was sought in 88% (96) of 109 medically suitable brain dead patients and granted in 70% (67) of these. Half those with permission for multiorgan donation had only the kidneys removed. CONCLUSIONS--More organs may be lost owing to transplant team logistics than by failure to seek consent from relatives of brain dead patients. The estimated size of the pool of potential donors depends on what types of patients might be considered. Ensuring that all who die while being ventilated are tested for brain death and considering the potential for donation before withdrawing ventilation could yield more donors. Ventilating more patients who are hopelessly brain damaged to secure more donors raises ethical and economic issues."

Adenosine agonists and antagonists dose dependently accentuated and attenuated, respectively, ethanol-induced motor incoordination, thereby suggesting a central mechanism of adenosine modulation of this effect of ethanol and confirmed our previous reports in which adenosine agonists and antagonists were given i.p. Enprofylline, a weak adenosine antagonist but potent inhibitor of cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, did not alter ethanol's motor incoordination, further supporting involvement of brain adenosine receptor mechanism(s) in ethanol-adenosine interactions. Results from R-PIA and N6-(S-phenylisopropyl)adenosine experiments showed nearly a 40-fold greater potency of R-vs. S-diastereoisomer, suggesting predominance of adenosine A1 subtype. However, 5'-(N-cyclopropyl)-carboxamidoadenosine data indicate complexity of the mechanism(s) and point toward an additional involvement of a yet unknown subtype of adenosine A2. No effect of ethanol on blood or brain levels of [3H]R-PIA was noted and sufficient amount of the latter entered the brain to suggest adenosine receptor activation adequate to produce behavioral interaction with ethanol. There was no escape of i.c.v.-administered [3H]R-PIA from brain to the peripheral circulation ruling out a peripheral and supporting a central mechanism of ethanol-adenosine interaction."

Their management, particularly the role of surgical removal, is controversial. Deterioration often occurs late, and is unpredictable. Eight patients with traumatic intracerebral haematomas were admitted to the neurosurgical unit to monitor their clinical state. All were studied within 48 hours of admission with single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT), using the recently introduced radionuclide 99Technetiumm-Hexamethyl propylene amine oxime (99Tcm-HMPAO). At the time of the SPECT study, all the patients had been clinically stable. Three patients remained so; in the other five, the conscious level deteriorated, necessitating craniotomy and evacuation of the haematoma. In all the patients, the SPECT studies demonstrated perfusion defects that corresponded to the location of the haematoma, as demonstrated by computerised tomography (CT). However, in the five patients who subsequently deteriorated, the perfusion defects seen on the SPECT scan appeared larger than the haematoma, as seen on the CT scan. In addition, there was widespread poor retention of 99Tcm-HMPAO in the ipsilateral hemisphere. These differences were quantifiable. Interestingly, these differences were present at a time when the patients were clinically stable, before their deterioration. It is concluded that SPECT studies with 99Tcm-HMPAO are of possible use as predictors of late deterioration in the management of traumatic intracerebral haematomas."

Upon completion of left amygdaloid kindling, 4 cats underwent long-term phenobarbital administration during the subsequent 5- to 9-month rest period. Plasma phenobarbital levels were maintained above 15 to 20 micrograms/ml and were restimulated following plasma phenobarbital washout. Three cats served as nonmedicated controls. All 7 cats were subjected to repeated 6-hour sleep monitoring for observation of interictal discharges, which were observed most often in the immediate postictal period. Their frequency decreased gradually throughout the experiment in both the medicated and control animals, but they never completely disappeared except from the contralateral amygdala in 1 medicated animal. Upon primary site restimulation, all of the medicated animals responded with a generalized convulsion once the afterdischarge was induced. When these animals underwent secondary-site amygdaloid kindling, 3 showed a positive transfer effect. The findings suggest that although phenobarbital is a potent anticonvulsant, it has little effect on the acquired seizure susceptibility of previously amygdaloid kindled cats."

Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)-like necrotizing vasculitis of the small muscular arteries and arterioles, with acute and healing lesions in the leptomeninges, brain parenchyma and visceral organs was observed at postpartum autopsy. PAN-like vasculitis in the central nervous system is quite rare in SLE. This case is also suggestive in terms of the influence of pregnancy on the activity of SLE."

We studied 39 blind painful eyes in 39 patients who were treated with retrobulbar injection of absolute (96%) alcohol for their severe ocular pain at the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital from January 1984 to January 1987. There were 21 (54%) male and 18 (46%) female patients; all were followed for at least three months. The protracted ocular pain was mainly due to: end-stage (absolute) glaucoma in 31 (80%) eyes, uveitis or endophthalmitis in four (10%) eyes, or corneal ulcer in two (5%) eyes. One eye had painful phthisis bulbi, and one eye had infraorbital neuralgia. The complications encountered were transient and included blepharoptosis in eight (21%) eyes, external ophthalmoplegia, and corneal epithelial defect. The effective time of the injection to relieve pain ranged from two weeks to two years (mean, 29 weeks). The authors believe that there is still a place for retrobulbar alcohol injection for blind painful eyes when enucleation or evisceration is not possible."

    "abstract": "Codeine increases pain thresholds to copper vapor laser stimuli in extensive but not poor metabolizers of sparteine. The analgesic efficacy and kinetics of a single oral dose of 75 mg codeine was investigated in 12 extensive metabolizers and 12 poor metabolizers of sparteine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. The cosegregation of the O-demethylation of codeine to morphine with the sparteine oxidation polymorphism was confirmed. Hence morphine could not be detected in the plasma of any of the poor metabolizers, whereas detectable morphine plasma levels were found in 10 of 12 extensive metabolizers. Pain thresholds to laser stimuli were determined before drug intake and 90, 150, and 210 minutes after drug intake. Codeine significantly increased the pricking pain thresholds in the extensive metabolizers (p less than 0.05), whereas there were no significant changes in the poor metabolizers. No change in pain thresholds occurred with placebo in any of the two phenotypes. In the extensive metabolizers there was a significant positive correlation between the increase in pain threshold and plasma concentration of codeine. The study supports the hypothesis that morphine formation is essential for achievement of analgesia during codeine treatment."

Twelve consecutive patients (17 eyes) with tilted disc syndrome underwent quantified visual field examination with the G1 Octopus program (Interzeag AG, Schlieren, Switzerland). Visual fields were abnormal in all cases. Although field loss was more pronounced in the superotemporal quadrant (P less than .001), it also involved the other three quadrants, thus demonstrating that optic nerve hypoplasia in tilted disc syndrome is apparently not entirely sectorial. Linear regression analysis showed that an increase in mean defect correlated with increase in myopic refractive error (P less than .05). However, the increase in myopic refractive error was found to be related to a decrease in corrected loss variance (P less than .05), indicating that in tilted discs with higher myopia, field loss is more homogeneous. With this series of patients, short-term fluctuation was within normal ranges in all visual fields, showing that this may be an additional clue for differential diagnosis from acquired disorders."

These variables were measured initially and one year later in the quadriceps muscles of 28 symptomatic and 16 asymptomatic persons who had polio and 38 control individuals. Peak knee extension torque was measured isokinetically and isometrically. Endurance, or the amount of time the subject could maintain isometric torque at 40% of maximal torque, was measured. Work capacity was determined as the product of isometric torque and endurance time. Recovery of strength was measured at regular intervals for ten minutes after the endurance test. Statistical analysis was done by repeated measures ANOVA. Although the initial measures showed significant deficits in mean peak torque, work capacity, and recovery of strength in symptomatic postpolio subjects, no significant changes were found one year later in any of the variables. We conclude that symptomatic postpolio subjects do not lose significant neuromuscular function in one year."

To compare the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous and intravenous infusion of opioid analgesics, a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial was carried out in inpatients. 15 patients with severe cancer pain received two 48 h infusions of hydromorphone--one subcutaneously and one intravenously in randomly allocated order. The study was made double-blind by the use of two infusion pumps throughout; during the active subcutaneous infusion the intravenous pump delivered saline and vice versa. Serial measurements of pain intensity, pain relief, mood, and sedation by means of visual analogue scales showed no clinically or statistically significant difference between the two infusion routes. Side-effects were slight, and the mean number of morphine injections for breakthrough pain did not differ significantly between the routes (4.8 [SD 4.5] for intravenous vs 5.3 [5.6] for subcutaneous). Plasma hydromorphone concentrations measured at 24 h and 48 h of infusion showed stable steady-state pharmacokinetics; the mean bioavailability from subcutaneous infusion was 78% of that with intravenous infusion. Because of the simplicity, technical advantages, and cost-effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous opioid infusion into the chest wall or trunk, intravenous opioid infusion for the management of severe cancer pain should be abandoned."

We compared clinical symptoms with extent of brain shift on computed tomographic (CT) scans and quantitative and three-dimensional measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) on xenon-enhanced CT scans in 10 patients with chronic subdural hematomas. Five patients had only headache and minimal or no brain shift on a CT scan. The other five had hemiparesis and/or mental disturbance in addition to headache and moderate or severe brain shift on a CT scan. The mean hemispheric CBF decreased about 7% in patients with headache and about 35% in patients with hemiparesis and/or mental disturbance. It decreased also on the side without the hematoma. The CBF reduction was always more pronounced in the putamen and thalamus than in the cortex. On the contrary, the cortex CBF was mostly preserved or even elevated in both groups of patients. We speculate that CBF reduction in patients with a chronic subdural hematoma occurs initially in central cerebral areas like the basal ganglia and thalamus, and then extends to the entire hemisphere including the cortex as brain compression and displacement progress. Central cerebral area involvement might be more responsible for clinical symptoms than the cortex."

Recently, the ingestion of tryptophan has been associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, which is characterized by eosinophilia, myalgias, and several less consistently reported findings. We treated 13 patients who exhibited clinical features of eosinophilic fasciitis who were taking high-dose tryptophan before the onset of clinical symptoms. Twelve patients exhibited eosinophilia, with eosinophil counts ranging from 0.13 to 0.88. The remaining patient was taking oral corticosteroids when her eosinophil count was determined. Eight patients complained of myalgias. Other symptoms included arthralgias, pruritus, cutaneous burning, weakness, fever, rashes, malaise, edema, muscle spasms, and alopecia. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels were elevated in four of the eight urine specimens that were tested. Our findings suggest that previously diagnosed cases of eosinophilic fasciitis may represent variants of tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Derangements in the metabolism of tryptophan may play a role in sclerotic diseases."

    "abstract": "Influence of preservation or perfusion of intraoperatively identified spinal cord blood supply on spinal motor evoked potentials and paraplegia after aortic surgery. Permanent ligation of arteries supplying blood to the spinal cord in operations for aortic aneurysm can lead to spinal cord ischemia, which can result in either paraparesis or paraplegia. This report describes a rapid method of intraoperative identification of those arteries that supply the spinal cord by use of an intrathecal platinum electrode to detect hydrogen in solution that has been injected into the aortic ostia. Preservation or perfusion of those identified arteries supplying the spinal cord may decrease the rate of postoperative neurologic complications. Of 28 porcine experiments with postoperative observation for 24 hours, there were 3 initial pilot experiments in which saline saturated with hydrogen was injected into the temporarily cross-clamped aorta. Twenty animals were then randomized to (1) preservation of only the vessels sequentially identified to supply blood to the spinal cord from T-13 to L-5 (n = 10); (2) division of the vessels supplying the spinal cord (n = 10). A further five animals underwent perfusion experiments wherein the identified cord arteries were perfused by a shunt, the other nonsupply arteries were divided, and the aorta was kept clamped for 45 minutes. Spinal motor evoked potentials were elicited with an intrathecal electrode and were highly sensitive for paralysis. Paralysis occurred in 0/3 pilot (p less than 0.013 vs division); 8/10 division; 1/10 preservation (p less than 0.0017 vs division); and perfusion 1/5 (p less than 0.025 vs division). Results of a pilot study in eight humans shows that the technique can be used to rapidly identify segmental arteries supplying the spinal cord, to determine if distal perfusion is supplying the spinal cord with blood flow, and if reattached segmental arteries are patent."

The effects of continuous drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on vasospasm and hydrocephalus were analyzed retrospectively in 108 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who were operated on for ruptured aneurysms within 48 hours of their onset. Ninety-two of these patients underwent a procedure for CSF drainage (cisternal drainage, ventricular drainage, lumbar drainage, or a combination of these). The duration, the total volume, and the average daily volume of CSF drainage were 10.4 +/- 7.0 days (mean +/- SD). 2034 +/- 1566 ml, and 190 +/- 65.3 ml, respectively. Patients with a greater drainage volume at a lower height of drainage in the early period after SAH developed more cerebral infarctions later (P less than 0.025). The relationship between the total volume of CSF removed and shunt-dependent hydrocephalus was determined to be statistically significant (P less than 0.005). Cerebral infarction and hydrocephalus after SAH were also found to be statistically associated (P less than 0.001). Thus, continuous cerebrospinal fluid drainage should not be performed too readily in patients with SAH, because the removal of a large amount of CSF can induce cerebral vasospasm as well as hydrocephalus."

    "abstract": "Availability of transplantable organs from brain stem dead donors in intensive care units. OBJECTIVE--By audit from January to June 1989 to quantify, separately for hearts, kidneys, liver, lungs and corneas, the possible increases in transplantable organs from brain stem dead potential donors in intensive care units and to compare them with the increases achieved in October-November 1989, during intense, national publicity about transplantation. DESIGN--Prospective audit of all deaths in intensive care units in England from 1 January to 30 June 1989 and subsequent case study of the impact of publicity on offers and donations during October-November 1989. SETTING--15 regional and special health authorities in England. PATIENTS--5803 patients dying in intensive care units, of whom 497 were confirmed as brain stem dead and had no general medical contraindication to organ donation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Organ specific suitability for transplantation (as reported by intensive care units); consent for donation of specific suitable organs; and procurement of specific organs reported as suitable for transplantation and offered. RESULTS--In the 497 (8.6%) brain stem dead potential donors were estimated the organ specific suitability for heart as 63%, kidneys 95%, liver 70%, lungs 29%, and corneas 91%. Refusal of relatives (30%) accounted for major losses of suitable organs of all types. For kidneys the loss was equivalent to 44% of brain stem dead actual kidney donors. No discussion of organ donation was the second most important reason for missed kidney donors, the loss being equivalent to 10% of brain stem dead actual donors. Non-procurement or difficulties with allocating organs was the second most notable cause of missed suitable liver and lung donors; 29% (55) of the offered total of 189 liver donors and 27% (21) of 78 offered suitable lung donors in six months. Non-procurement of suitable, offered organs was rare for kidneys and modest, of the order of 13% and 10% respectively, for heart and corneas. Corneal donation from brain stem dead potential donors might be improved nearly as much (that is, a 78% increase in brain stem dead actual corneal donors) by specific measures to promote corneal donation when other organs are offered as by reducing the overall refusal rate. Restricted offers, non-procurement, and no discussion of donation accounted for nearly equal numbers of lost donations of hearts (each equivalent to 15% of donated hearts). During October-November 1989 when there was intense, positive publicity about transplantation the rates of refusal and non-discussion fell compared with during January-June (22%, 36/163 v 30%, 138/460; 7%, 33/497 v 2%, 4/167 respectively). Offers of suitable donors increased significantly (p less than 0.02) compared with the first six months of 1989, most notably for heart donors (80 v 60.1 expected) and kidney donors (122 v 102.1 expected) but only for kidneys was there a noticeable 17% increase in actual donors (118 actual audited donors v 100.8 expected donors; p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS--Four strategies to increase the supply of transplantable organs from brain stem dead potential donors in intensive care units were identified: (a) reducing refusal of relatives (b) avoiding non-procurement of actually suitable organs (by logistical initiatives) and deterioration of initially suitable organs (by donor care initiatives); (c) converting restricted offers to unrestricted offers; and (d) ensuring discussion with families. Early referral to the transplant team or coordinator gives time for discussion about donor care and agreement on medical suitability for donation of specific organs. Solving some of the logistical problems of non-procurement may be a prerequisite for increased offers to be translated into increased donations. The impact of publicity therefore needs to be measured on offers of suitable donors as well as by actual donations."

    "abstract": "Evidence for platelet-activating factor as a novel mediator in experimental stroke in rabbits. Platelet-activating factor is a potent mediator of inflammation, which has untoward effects on cerebrovascular and neural elements. While several investigators have reported attenuation of ischemic damage after treatment with antagonists of platelet-activating factor, no study has proved endogenous production of platelet-activating factor in ischemia of the central nervous system. We hypothesized that endogenous production of platelet-activating factor participates in the early pathologic manifestations of deteriorating stroke. In 12 rabbits, we found tissue levels of platelet-activating factor measured by the release of serotonin from washed platelets to be elevated by approximately 20-fold in spinal cord injured by 25 minutes of ischemia and 2 hours of reperfusion (2.80 +/- 0.98 ng/g) compared with that in normal spinal cord (0.15 +/- 0.06 ng/g, p less than 0.01). Given during ischemia to seven rabbits, 10 mg/kg i.p. of a highly selective and potent antagonist of platelet-activating factor (BN 50739) accentuated the early postischemic hyperemia and prevented the delayed hypoperfusion measured by on-line laser-Doppler flowmetry (-35 +/- 7% of baseline [n = 7] without versus 33 +/- 14% with treatment, p less than 0.01) and the edema formation measured as the increase in tissue water content (4.4 +/- 0.7% without [n = 6] versus 2.1 +/- 0.6% with [n = 7]treatment, p less than 0.05) after 2 hours of reperfusion. This neurochemical and pharmacologic evidence emphasizes a new perspective of ischemia-induced phospholipid degradation and suggests an important role for platelet-activating factor in the early manifestations of stroke."

A comparison and diagnostic applications. Cerebrospinal fluid and serum immunoglobulin G from 1007 patients with suspected neurological disease were analysed by 2 methods: isoelectric focusing for the detection of oligoclonal banding, and quantitative measurement of IgG and albumin for the formulation of a Log IgG-Index. A comparison of the 2 methods in the detection of local synthesis of IgG showed that isoelectric focusing not only gave a much higher yield overall, with 282 patients showing local synthesis versus 225 for the Log IgG-Index, but also a higher specificity, with a false positive rate of 0% versus 3.5%. In addition, of the 282 patients positive by isoelectric focusing only 163 (58%) were positive by the Log IgG-Index. Of the 1007 patients studied, 206 had multiple sclerosis (MS), and isoelectric focusing showed local synthesis in 95% of clinically definite cases, with a 90% detection rate overall. The Log IgG-Index was positive in only 67% of clinically definite cases, with an overall 59% detection rate. Thus with the exceptions noted above, local synthesis of IgG as defined by isoelectric focusing is confined to demyelinating, inflammatory, infectious and postinfectious disorders. Our results compare very favourably with the published sensitivities of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of abnormalities in multiple sclerosis, and better than those for evoked potentials. Where both these investigations are readily available isoelectric focusing provides a useful adjunct. For the majority of physicians and neurologists who do not have ready access to magnetic resonance imaging, isoelectric focusing is an excellent alternative. We would also recommend that it become the standard for the measurement of IgG abnormalities in the cerebrospinal fluid and that the use of quantitative data be abandoned for routine purposes."

Structural abnormalities, delayed myelination, or a combination of the two were detected with MRI at 8 months of age in all nine infants with later development of cerebral palsy. Three of the four normal infants and one infant with suggestive abnormalities had normal serial MRI findings. Each of the remaining two infants (one normal, one with suggestive abnormalities) had isolated persistent ventricular dilation on all three MRI studies.

This paper reviews reports of phantom limb sensations which resemble somatosensory events experienced in the limb before amputation. It also presents descriptions of this phenomenon in 68 amputees who took part in a series of clinical studies. These somatosensory memories are predominantly replicas of distressing pre-amputation lesions and pains which were experienced at or near the time of amputation, and are described as having the same qualities of sensation as the pre-amputation pain. The patients who experience these pains emphasize that they are suffering real pain which they can describe in vivid detail, and insist that the experience is not merely a cognitive recollection of an earlier pain. Reports of somatosensory memories are less common when there has been a discontinuity, or a pain-free interval, between the experience of pain and amputation. Among the somatosensory memories reported are cutaneous lesions, deep tissue injuries, bone and joint pain and painful pre-amputation postures. The experience of somatosensory memories does not appear to be related to the duration of pre-amputation pain, time since amputation, age, gender, prosthetic use, level of amputation, number of limbs amputated, or whether the amputation followed an accident or illness. The results suggest that somatosensory inputs of sufficient intensity and duration can produce lasting changes in central neural structures which combine with cognitive-evaluative memories of the pre-amputation pain to give rise to the unified experience of a past pain referred to the phantom limb. Implications for pre- and post-operative pain control are discussed."

In every patient the original diagnosis fulfilled also the IHS criteria, but in 9 patients the criteria were only fulfilled in half or less of the attacks, and applying the IHS criteria they also achieved an additional diagnosis. In one patient these attacks did not fulfill the pain criteria and in 8 (4 migraine, 4 tension headache) they did not fulfill the criteria for accompanying symptoms.

The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate programmed ventricular stimulation in patients less than 21 years of age undergoing electrophysiologic testing. A standardized protocol was applied in 55 consecutive patients (mean age 14 years) with the following clinical presentations: sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 17); ventricular fibrillation (VF) (n = 7); syncope with heart disease (n = 10); nonsustained VT (n = 6); and syncope with an ostensibly normal heart (n = 15). The stimulation protocol consisted of 1 and 2 ventricular extrastimuli during sinus rhythm, followed by 1 to 4 (S2, S3, S4, S5) extrastimuli during pacing at 2 ventricular sites. Of the 17 patients with sustained VT, 12 had induction of the arrhythmia (sensitivity = 71%). Overall, 18 of 55 patients had inducible sustained VT, with this response significantly enhanced by use of S4 or S5 protocols (p = 0.02). Although no syncope patients with an ostensibly normal heart had inducible sustained VT, 7 had polymorphic nonsustained VT in response to ventricular stimulation. The mean number of extra-stimuli preceding the induction of nonsustained or sustained VT or VF did not differ. The induction of VF in 5 cases during this study was preceded in each case by extrastimuli intervals less than or equal to 190 ms. Thus, data indicate that aggressive stimulation protocols appear to be required for induction of sustained VT in most young patients, nonsustained polymorphic VT as a response to aggressive programmed stimulation is of uncertain significance, and that coupling intervals less than or equal to 190 ms may correlate with the induction of VF."

A new model of chronic hypersensitivity was developed in the rat by daily intraplantar administration of either prostaglandin E2 dopamine or isoprenaline, for a period of 2 weeks. Like other hyperalgesic mediators, dibutyryl-cAMP, when applied to the paws, caused an acute effect but did not produce persistent hypersensitivity. The persistent hypersensitive state was not affected by a typical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (indomethacin), was temporarily inhibited by a centrally acting analgesic (morphine), was partially inhibited by a protein synthesis inhibitor (cycloheximide) and abolished by a single dose of peripherally acting analgesics such as dipyrone or N-methyl morphine. Once the residual hypersensitivity had been abolished with dipyrone or N-methyl morphine, a small dose of prostaglandin E2, dopamine or Interleukin-1 beta, which in normal animals causes a mild and short lived effect, restored the persistent hypersensitive state. This ability to restore the persistent effect was not observed with intraplantar administration of dibutyryl-cAMP. Our results suggest the existence of a peripheral trace of inflammatory pain, a phenomenon which may be associated with stimulation of neuronal adenylate cyclase and protein synthesis. This concept may explain part of the puzzle of chronic inflammatory pain and lead to the development of new analgesics."

Eighteen patients with 20 symptomatic hips underwent lengthening of the iliopsoas tendon for persistent painful snapping of this \"internal\" variety of snapping hip. We referred to the pathologic, painful snapping of the iliopsoas in the deep anterior groin as the \"internal\" snapping hip. This is in contrast to the more common and better-known \"external\" snapping that involves the greater trochanter and its overlying soft tissues. The results of our iliopsoas lengthening procedure are presented here. Lengthening of the iliopsoas tendon was accomplished by step cutting of the tendinous portion of the iliopsoas. The pathoanatomy of this poorly understood symptom complex was described in 1984 paper from this institution and is reviewed here. Iliopsoas bursography demonstrated a sudden jerking movement of the iliopsoas tendon between the anterior inferior iliac spine and iliopectineal eminence, synchronous with the patient's pain and often accompanied by an audible snap. The average preoperative duration of symptoms was 2.9 years, and the average length of postoperative followup was 25 months. All patients, except one, had a marked reduction in the frequency of snapping after tendon lengthening, and 14 of 20 hips had no snapping postoperatively. Of the six patients who had recurrence of snapping, all but one stated that this occurred much less frequently and was much less painful compared to the preoperative state. Two hips required reoperation. Postoperatively, only three patients complained of subjective weakness, and most patients were unlimited in physical activity with return to activities such as competitive football, pole vaulting, and long-distance running."

We studied 10 patients aged 22.5 +/- 6.0 years with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy selected because of a history of a prolonged childhood convulsion, which is characteristic of a group of patients in whom hippocampal sclerosis is a constant finding. All 10 patients showed reduction in size of one hippocampus associated with increased signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. These changes were reliably detected on coronal spin-echo images, perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus. Appreciation of the normal imaging anatomy of the hippocampus allowed correct interpretation of the relative changes in signal intensities of the hippocampus and adjacent temporal horn on sequential echo images. The side of the abnormal hippocampus on magnetic resonance imaging accorded with the electroencephalographic localization in all 10 patients, and with the lateralization of the early convulsions in all 6 patients where this was known. Temporal lobectomy was performed in all 10 patients. Hippocampal sclerosis was confirmed in the 3 patients in whom hippocampal tissue was available for histological examination. The value of this technique was reinforced by the excellent postoperative results, with 80% being seizure free at a mean follow-up time of 33 +/- 4 months."

    "abstract": "The role of neutrophils and platelets in a rabbit model of thromboembolic stroke. Cerebral ischemia is accompanied by many of the cardinal features of acute inflammation such as neutrophil and platelet activation and accumulation. We sought to determine whether circulating neutrophils or platelets contribute to brain injury in a rabbit model of thromboembolic stroke that includes a fixed duration of superimposed systemic hypotension. We randomized 18 rabbits to receive either antineutrophil antiserum (n = 6), antiplatelet antiserum (n = 5), or nonimmune serum (n = 7). We assessed brain ischemia by measuring cerebral blood flow, intracranial pressure, and infarct size. Following the intracarotid administration of an autologous clot, cerebral blood flow in all groups fell to less than 5 ml/100 g/min during induced hypotension. After restoration of baseline blood pressure, mean cerebral blood flow in neutropenic animals recovered to 20-30 ml/100 g/min while that in control and thrombocytopenic rabbits remained at less than 10 ml/100 g/min. Intracranial pressure in control animals rose steadily to a final value of 241% of baseline, while a much smaller increase (148% of baseline) was noted in the thrombocytopenic group; no change from baseline was evident in the neutropenic group. Infarct size was significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced in the neutropenic group but not in the thrombocytopenic group. These results suggest that neutrophils may be important contributors to ischemia-induced brain injury whereas the role of platelets is more subtle."

    "abstract": "A comparison of the efficacy and safety of pergolide and bromocriptine in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia. Pergolide is a synthetic ergoline derivative with highly potent long-acting PRL-lowering activity, allowing therapy of hyperprolactinemia with a once daily administration of the drug. The results of two open-label, randomized controlled multicenter clinical trials are reported. Pergolide (taken once a day), was compared with bromocriptine (taken two to four times daily) regarding efficacy and safety in the reduction of PRL levels, the cessation of galactorrhea and amenorrhea, the improvement in sexual function, and tumor shrinkage in hyperprolactinemia without (trial I; 61 patients) and with radiologically evident pituitary tumors (trial II; 96 patients). Both drugs were equally effective in lowering PRL levels in both trials. A median optimal dose of 50 micrograms pergolide and 5 mg bromocriptine/day suppressed PRL levels in the 61 patients of trial I by more than 80%. During the 24-week investigational period galactorrhea disappeared in 96% and 87% of patients, whereas menstruation returned in 90% and 96% of patients, respectively. An equally high efficacy (optimal median dose: 75-100 micrograms pergolide, 7.5-10 mg bromocriptine daily) was observed in trial II, although the resumption of menses was less frequent than in the patients of trial I (50% and 58% of patients, respectively). Sexual dysfunction improved similarly on both drugs in about half the patients. In addition, tumor shrinkage occurred to a similar extent with both drugs. A high incidence of adverse events was noted especially at the initiation of therapy with both compounds: nausea, dizziness, vomiting, asthenia, headache, and decrease in blood pressure occurred at a similar incidence and extent during the use of pergolide and bromocriptine. Patients in trial I treated with pergolide reported a slightly higher incidence of fever, vasodilatation, and flu syndrome. Conclusions: in these 24-week studies comprising a total of 157 hyperprolactinemic patients, a once daily administration of pergolide was shown to be as safe and effective as the two to four times daily ingestion of bromocriptine. Longer-acting dopamine agonists like pergolide that can be taken once daily, are likely to increase the ease to adherence to the therapeutic regimen. This might result in a higher compliance to medical treatment of hyperprolactinemia."

Ultrastructural immunoreactivities of alpha B-crystallin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin, and vimentin in Rosenthal fibers (RFs) isolated from an Alexander's disease brain were investigated using nonosmium and low-temperature embedding technique. The morphology of RFs embedded in Lowicryl K4M resin was well preserved after treatment with 0.5% Triton X-100. alpha B-crystallin immunoreactivity was present in RFs of various sizes and was the strongest in loosely scattered deposits, which were considered to be the initial stage of RFs. Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity in RFs was heavy, homogeneous throughout RFs, and equivalent to that in networks of glial filaments. Immunoreactivities of both alpha B-crystallin and GFAP were mainly restricted to the high electron-dense areas within RFs and were proved to exist close to each other by double immunolabeling. Rosenthal fibers were negative for vimentin. Ubiquitin immunoreactivity was relatively homogeneous in RFs with small diameters, but in RFs with large diameters, the immunoreactivity diminished in the center. Based on these observations, combined with the tendency of self-aggregation of alpha B-crystallin, it is conceivable that RFs are huge aggregation products of alpha B-crystallin involving GFAP, and that ubiquitination may be a consequent phenomenon, as it may be in other intracytoplasmic inclusions, such as neurofibrillary tangles and Lewy bodies."

A variant of the interstitial cystitis (IC) syndrome, minimal or no pain or significant pain that has been lessened by another therapy, can be clinically improved by retraining of the individual's voiding pattern. Patients with greater pain but capable of completing this protocol also may be helped. While this group of patients fills the diagnostic criteria of IC and has many of the classic changes, many differ in that they have minimal or no pain, while simultaneously they have a dysfunctional bladder as expected from long-term low-volume voiding. All patients were placed on a protocol which focused on progressively increasing intervals between voids. Fifteen to thirty minutes initially were added to their present voiding time. The same increase was added to the voiding pattern every three or four weeks until an interval of three to four hours between voids was achieved. Twenty-one patients fit the criteria to be entered into this study. Overall 71 percent (15/21) had successful management of their symptoms and reported a 50 percent decrease in their symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency, and nocturia. Nineteen percent (4/21) reported 25 percent decrease in symptoms and 10 percent had no change. Presence of significant pain adversely affects outcome, 3/7 (with pain) improvements versus 12/14 (without pain). For all patients there was a significant increase in bladder capacity (92 mL average before study and 179 mL after) and average daily voids (13.2/day prestudy and 7.4 post-therapy).

    "abstract": "Comparative pharmacodynamics and brain distribution of E-delta 2-valproate and valproate in rats. The E-isomer of 2-unsaturated valproate (E-delta 2-VPA) is a pharmacologically active metabolite of VPA that is less teratogenic and hepatotoxic than its saturated precursor. To assess potential use of E-delta 2-VPA as an alternate to VPA, a dose-response study comparing the anticonvulsant activity and neurotoxicity of E-delta 2-VPA and VPA was conducted in rats using the intravenous (i.v.) pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-infusion threshold seizure model. Assay of drug in whole brain and plasma allowed comparison of the drug concentration-effect relationships and the brain distribution characteristics of the two compounds. E-delta 2-VPA was two to three times more potent than VPA in elevating the clonic seizure threshold of PTZ, in reference to either plasma or whole-brain drug concentrations. Furthermore, much steeper response curves were observed with E-delta 2-VPA as compared with VPA. Within the pharmacologic concentration range (defined as EC25 to EC75), E-delta 2-VPA was less neurotoxic than VPA as assessed by behavioral tests. Therefore, E-delta 2-VPA has a much more favorable protective index than VPA. At low doses, the concentration ratios of brain to plasma for both E-delta 2-VPA and VPA increased markedly with increasing plasma drug concentration. E-delta 2-VPA and VPA were previously shown to exhibit saturable binding to rat plasma proteins. If we assume that uptake of drug into the CNS is limited to the equilibrium plasma free fraction in the brain microvasculature, much of the nonlinear brain distribution features of VPA could be accounted for by saturable drug plasma protein binding. On the other hand, more complex kinetics involving simultaneous saturation of plasma protein binding and blood-to-brain transport are proposed to explain the brain distribution of the unsaturated compound. In addition, the brain-to-free drug concentration ratios for both E-delta 2-VPA and VPA were below unity at high drug-concentration range, consistent with the presence of an efficient efflux mechanism of these compounds from brain."

The DA strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (DAV) causes a chronic demyelinating disease in susceptible mouse strains. To elucidate the pathogenesis of DAV-induced demyelination, the authors investigated the spatial and chronologic relationship between virus (antigen and RNA), myelin-specific mRNAs, and demyelination in DAV-infected mice using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and slot blot hybridization analyses. In spinal cord white matter, viral RNA was detected easily in ventral root entry zones 1 to 2 weeks after infection. Viral RNA increased to maximum levels by 4 weeks after infection, which was associated with inflammation and mild demyelination. At 8 to 12 weeks after infection, when demyelination became most extensive, viral RNA was significantly decreased. Demyelination did not chronologically or spatially parallel the presence of viral RNA within the spinal cord. Decrease of myelin-specific mRNAs, including myelin-basic protein and proteolipid protein mRNAs, was observed within the demyelinating lesions with or without detectable viral RNA. These results indicate that a viral infection of white matter in the early phase of the infection initiates spinal cord disease leading to demyelination, but later an ongoing immunopathologic process contributes to the presence of extensive demyelination."

Follow-up was 1-15 years (mean, 6 years) in 28 patients and 6-10 months (mean, 7 months) in seven. A total of 158 embolization procedures were performed in 35 patients. Revascularization occurred frequently, necessitating multiple endovascular sessions. Long-term clinical evaluation showed clinical improvement, compared with the initial status before treatment, in 63% of the patients. Clinical aggravation due to embolization was observed in seven patients (20%) after 12 of the 158 endovascular sessions (8%). These results are better than those reported after surgery and indicate that embolization with particles is an efficient and safe tool in the treatment of thoracic intramedullary AVMs."

The pathophysiology and options for management of bone metastases as well as criteria for determining response to therapy are reviewed. Bone metastases are frequently one of the first signs of disseminated disease in cancer patients. In the majority of patients, the primary tumor is in the breast, prostate, or lungs. Although almost all patients will die of their disease, a proportion of the patients will survive for several years. Treatment is primarily palliative: the intention is to relieve pain, prevent fractures, maintain activity and mobility, and, if possible, to prolong survival. Therapeutic options include local treatment with radiotherapy and/or surgery, and systemic treatment using chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, radioisotopes, agents such as diphosphonates, which inhibit resorption of bone, as well as analgesic and antiinflammatory drugs. The mechanisms by which pain is relieved by several of these therapies remain unclear but actions beyond a simple tumoricidal effect appear to be important. There have been few randomized trials comparing the therapeutic options, and the criteria for assessing response to therapy have, in general, been poorly defined. There is a need for rigorous clinical investigations that assess the efficacy of the various therapeutic possibilities by using well-defined and validated criteria of response."

Forty-seven patients underwent selective catheterization of middle and lower thoracic intercostal and upper lumbar arteries to define the origin of the artery of Adamkiewicz. One patient had significant atheroembolism, and a second had transient lower extremity paresthesias. No other complications occurred. The origin was found in 26 (55%), and 21 patients underwent thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair with this knowledge. When the critical lumbar or intercostal artery could be included as part of a long proximal or distal anastomosis, all 12 patients could be included as part of a long proximal or distal anastomosis, all 12 patients survived, and one was paralyzed. However, if the aneurysm repair mandated a midgraft anastomosis to intercostal arteries critical to spinal cord perfusion, seven of nine patients either died or were paralyzed (p less than 0.05). In the group of 19 patients operated on in whom spinal cord blood supply was not identified three patients had a technically unsuccessful operation; two died, and one was paralyzed. Twelve of 16 patients who had an adequate, but unsuccessful attempt at localization were treated by intercostal \"neglect\" and survived. Late paresis developed in two patients, but they are walking now. One of the patients who died had multiple systems failure and awakened paraplegic. She had a patent, enlarged, thoracic radicular artery at T-5 which probably supplied to spinal cord and which was missed angiographically. Paralysis was associated with aneurysm extent (group 2 and III B, dissections vs group 1 & 3, p less than 0.05). Selective intercostal angiography requires further refinement, but it is safe and offers the promise of understanding the mechanisms and risks of spinal cord complications after repair of extensive thoracoabdominal aneurysms."

The mean N20 and P25 latencies were significantly prolonged two hours post treatment in the affected hemisphere (N20, P less than 0.01, P25 P less than 0.01). Nicardipine (Ni) had no effect on SEP components in the intact hemispheres. Seventy five per cent of the 12 patients with hypertension had a decrease in blood pressure (BP) after taking nicardipine, but there were no undesirable side effects or worsening of neurological signs. Our study demonstrates that nicardipine prolongs the latencies of short-latency components of SEP in the affected hemisphere after acute ischaemic stroke and also decreases BP. These observations suggest that nicardipine therapy might impair neuronal function in the ischaemic zone."

To determine the subjective perception patients have of abnormal movements, 170 patients with various hyperkinesias were interviewed with questions directed at the \"voluntary\" or intentional versus \"involuntary\" aspects of their symptoms. One hundred and two of 110 patients with non-tic disorders thought that the abnormal movements were entirely involuntary. Forty-one of 60 tic disorder patients stated that all their motor and phonic tics were intentionally produced. Fifteen others had both voluntary and involuntary components, usually with the former predominating. A \"voluntary\" response could be used to predict the correct diagnostic category (tic versus non-tic) in 8 of 9 patients for whom the referral category was incorrect. These results suggest that a large proportion of the motor and phonic symptoms experienced by tic patients are irresistibly but purposefully executed, more akin to compulsions than to the other \"involuntary\" hyperkinesias with which they are commonly discussed."

Thirty-six patients reported the occurrence of one or more syncopal episodes (group 1) and 65 patients had no syncope (group 2). These two groups did not differ significantly with regard to age, gender, incidence and characteristics of arrhythmia, clinical history, frequency of arrhythmic events and presence of associated cardiac disease.

There were no statistical differences between the two groups with respect to the effective refractory period of the right atrium, atrioventricular node, accessory pathway and right ventricle. Furthermore, no differences between the two groups were noted with respect to cycle length of circus movement tachycardia, mean heart rate during atrial fibrillation, and minimum RR interval during atrial fibrillation. In addition, the accessory pathway location was not significantly different between group 1 and group 2. The occurrence of syncope could not be predicted from any electrophysiologic finding and this symptom had a low sensitivity and specificity for recognition of dangerous rapid heart rates.

Fifty-five children had 64 external ventricular drains (EVDs) placed predominantly (95%) for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt infections. In 9 children, a computer monitoring system measured the CSF output each second continuously for up to 24 hours. The monitoring was repeated daily for up to 9 days. The state of arousal of the patients was recorded simultaneously. In all children, daily EVD outputs were related to age, sex, weight, method of establishing the EVD, height of the drip chamber, time since insertion, and type of infecting organism. Computer monitoring revealed wide fluctuations in flow rate, with peak rates frequently greater than 20 ml/h and periods of flow arrest. These changes were usually associated with increased arousal, but also occurred with sleep. The mean EVD flow rate for all children was 6.3 ml/h. EVD output increased with age and weight. EVD output decreased with Gram-negative or multiple-organism infections and with elevation of the drip chamber. Resolution of the infection, sex of the patient, and method of establishing the EVD had no effect on output. These results predict that CSF production increases with brain growth in humans: that CSF production is depressed by Gram-negative and multiple-organism infections: that implanted CSF shunts with standard valves flow at equivalent rates to an EVD in the supine position; and that the CSF drainage requirements in this group are approximately equal to their EVD outputs."

Pulsatile administration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone represents a major advance in the treatment of anovulation in women who fail to ovulate with clomiphene citrate and is an alternative for many women who currently receive human menopausal gonadotropin. Four issues must be addressed before administering pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone: (1) safety, (2) efficacy, (3) convenience, and (4) cost. Each of these issues will be affected by the three major decisions a physician makes with gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy: (1) patient selection, (2) route of administration, and (3) dose of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. The ideal candidate for gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy is a patient with an absence of endogenous pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone, as seen in hypothalamic amenorrhea. Although women with polycystic ovarian disease can be treated with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone, a decreased ovulation rate should be expected. The route of administration, intravenous or subcutaneous, and the degree of monitoring can be tailored by the physician to fit each patient's needs. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy is a safe, effective, convenient, and economical alternative to human menopausal gonadotropin for ovulation induction in women resistant to clomiphene."

Neuroborreliosis, a tick-borne spirochaetosis of the central nervous system, is diagnosed by the presence of intrathecally synthesized Borrelia burgdorferi-specific antibodies. Multiple sclerosis and neuroborreliosis can show similarities in clinical symptoms as well as lymphocytic cell reactions and oligoclonal bands in the isoelectric focusing of cerebrospinal fluid. To differentiate between multiple sclerosis and neuroborreliosis we tested intrathecally synthesized IgM and virus antibodies. The IgM indices were higher for most of the neuroborreliosis patients studied than for those with multiple sclerosis, and cell counts were also significantly higher in the acute stage of the disease. In 84% of multiple sclerosis patients we were able to demonstrate intrathecal antibody production against measles, rubella or mumps virus. Neuroborreliosis patients had no intrathecal virus antibody synthesis. The specification of oligoclonal bands resulting from isoelectric focusing of cerebrospinal fluid with an ELISA for B. burgdorferi can further substantiate the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis or help to rule it out in multiple sclerosis patients with positive borrelia-specific serology."

Brain and retinal infarctions during sleep have been attributed to focal hypoperfusion caused by systemic hypotension combined with underlying arterial stenosis, rather than to embolism. Because some retinal emboli may be visualized on ophthalmoscopy, we studied 24 consecutive patients (18 men and six women) aged 26-78 (mean 58) years with recent retinal infarction and determined whether the infarction had occurred during sleep or wakefulness. All patients underwent dilated ophthalmoscopy and a carotid artery study (arteriography in 20, duplex ultrasound in the remaining four), and 12 had echocardiography. Retinal infarction occurred during sleep at an unexpectedly rate (14 of 24 observed compared with eight of 24 expected, p = 0.02). Retinal cholesterol emboli were seen in one half of the patients regardless of whether the retinal infarction had occurred during sleep or wakefulness. Carotid artery disease was found in seven of the 14 patients in whom infarction had occurred during sleep and in eight of the 10 patients in whom infarction had occurred during wakefulness (p = 0.21). Cerebrovascular occlusive disease was not found in the five patients aged less than 50 years. Our findings suggest that embolism is a common mechanism of retinal infarction during sleep or wakefulness, that in patients aged greater than 50 years extracranial carotid artery disease is a common source of retinal emboli, and that the retina may be especially susceptible to infarction during sleep."

    "abstract": "Evidence against leukotrienes as mediators of brain edema. Leukotrienes are powerful metabolites of arachidonic acid which are known to increase the permeability of peripheral blood vessels. These substances are found in brain tissue in association with cerebral ischemia, and in brain tumors. Therefore, it has been proposed that leukotrienes have a mediator function in brain edema. This hypothesis was subjected to further experimental analysis in this study, in which the authors investigated whether: 1) superfusion of the exposed brain surface with leukotrienes increases the permeability of extraparenchymal blood vessels in vivo; 2) intraparenchymal infusion of leukotrienes induces brain edema; and 3) pharmacological inhibition of leukotriene formation by BW755C, an inhibitor of leukotriene synthesis, reduces formation of brain edema from a standardized traumatic insult. The pial vessels of the parietal cortex of cats were examined by fluorescence microscopy during cerebral superfusion with the leukotrienes C4 (LTC4), D4 (LTD4), or E4 (LTE4) by using an open cranial window preparation. Intravenous Na(+)-fluorescein served as an in vivo blood-brain barrier (BBB) indicator. Superfusion of the pia with leukotrienes (up to 2 microM) did not open the barrier to fluorescein, but was associated with a significant constriction (up to 25%) of arterial and venous vessels. In experiments with slow infusion of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) or LTC4 into the white matter of feline brain, the tissue water content was subsequently determined in serial brain slices using the specific gravity method. Tissue water profiles obtained after a 15-microM infusion of either LTB4 or LTC4 were virtually identical with those of control animals infused with mock cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, neither LTB4 nor LTC4 led to an augmentation of infusion-induced brain edema. In a final series, a cold lesion of the left parietal cortex was induced in rabbits. Twenty-four hours later, swelling of the exposed hemisphere was quantified by gravimetrical comparison of its weight with that of the contralateral nontraumatized hemisphere. Eight animals received BW755C intravenously prior to and after trauma to inhibit formation of leukotrienes. Seven rabbits were infused with an equivalent volume of saline as a control study. The resulting hemispheric swelling was 7.7% +/- 0.6% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) 24 hours later in animals receiving BW755C and 7.8% +/- 1.2% in the control group, indicating that inhibition of leukotrienes was ineffective in preventing formation of vasogenic brain edema. The findings demonstrate that leukotrienes administered to the brain in concentrations occurring under pathological conditions do not open the BBB nor do they induce brain edema.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)."

    "abstract": "Lesions of the mid-shaft of the humerus presenting as shoulder capsulitis. We describe three patients who presented with pain and restriction of movement at the shoulder suggestive of capsulitis, but proved to have lesions of the mid-shaft of the humerus. It is important to be aware of the possibility of this cause of a 'frozen shoulder', since radiographs of the shoulder are usually cropped at the mid-humerus and lesions at this level may easily be missed. A radiograph of the entire humerus, or an isotope bone scan, may be more useful than repeated shoulder radiographs in patients whose shoulder symptoms do not respond to standard treatment."

    "abstract": "The value of intubating and paralyzing patients with suspected head injury in the emergency department. One hundred consecutive trauma patients who underwent planned emergency intubation with muscle paralysis in the ED were studied to investigate the safety of these procedures and to determine their impact on the evaluation of patients with suspected head injury. Patients were intubated by either a surgeon (n = 47) or anesthesiologist (n = 53), and paralyzed with either vecuronium (n = 59) or succinylcholine (n = 41). Nasal intubation was used in 40 patients, oral in 57, and cricothyroidotomy in three. Ninety-four patients with suspected head injuries had a CT scan performed. Fifty-five (59%) had a positive scan and 15 required emergent neurosurgical intervention. Only two patients had lateral cervical spine roentgenograms before intubation; seven patients were eventually found to have cervical fractures. No patient suffered a neurologic deficit. One patient developed aspiration pneumonia following intubation. The three failed intubations occurred in patients with multiple facial fractures. We conclude that induced paralysis and intubation in the ED is safe, can facilitate the diagnostic workup, and may be a potentially life-saving maneuver in combative trauma patients."

    "abstract": "Mortality in acute stroke with atrial fibrillation. The Italian Acute Stroke Study Group. We compared 211 consecutive patients who had acute ischemic hemispheric stroke and atrial fibrillation with 837 consecutive patients who had stroke without atrial fibrillation. The atrial fibrillation group included a higher frequency of women, older subjects, and those with a severe neurologic deficit, abnormal computed tomogram, and elevated heart rate. The 1-month case-fatality rate in the atrial fibrillation group was 27% while that in the group without atrial fibrillation was 14%. The 6-month case-fatality rates in the two groups were 40% and 20%, respectively. The risk of death attributable to atrial fibrillation, adjusted for the effect of other prognostic factors, was significant at 1 month (relative risk = 1.55) and at 6 months (relative risk = 1.74). The causes of death were equally distributed in the two groups during both the acute and subacute phases. We conclude that atrial fibrillation is a negative prognostic factor in patients hospitalized for acute stroke. Nevertheless, cerebral embolism alone does not completely explain the increase in mortality for stroke patients with atrial fibrillation. Other associated pathogenetic mechanisms must also be taken into account."

    "abstract": "Thrombolytic therapy for noncoronary diseases. Thrombolytic therapy has been used fairly extensively in the management of acute proximal deep-vein thrombophlebitis of the extremities, acute pulmonary embolism, and acute peripheral arterial thrombosis and embolism in addition to acute thrombotic coronary events. In the presence of acceptable indications and a favorable benefit to risk ratio, this form of therapy, when successful, has served as a useful adjunct in the management of these disorders. In deep-vein thrombophlebitis, lysis of the thrombus before permanent pathological changes (eg, organization, scarring) have occurred can prevent venous valvular dysfunction and postural venous hypertension and its complications, especially the postphlebitic syndrome. In the more severe forms of acute pulmonary embolism, thrombolytic therapy, when applied early after symptom onset, decreases morbidity and is likely to prevent a chronic increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and persistent pulmonary hypertension. In peripheral arterial thrombo-occlusive events, early restoration of flow through thrombolysis has been shown to limit ischemic damage and serve as a useful supplement to angioplasty or surgery. Thrombolytic therapy has been used less extensively in acute strokes. Here the danger of reperfusion causing bleeding into a softened area of brain undergoing infarction has slowed its evaluation for this disorder; its application to stroke remains experimental."

This cross-sectional study was conducted to describe the epidemiology of epilepsy in Guaymi Indians residing in Changuinola, a small town on Panama's Caribbean coast near Costa Rica. We randomly selected households and attempted to enroll all residents aged less than or equal to 1 year; 337 eligible subjects agreed to participate (93% response rate). We administered a standard neurologic disease screening examination to all subjects and, if any abnormality was found, we administered a standard neurologic evaluation. We detected 19 cases of active epilepsy; the mean age at onset was 12 years, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures were the most common diagnosis (10 of 19, 53%). The prevalence of active epilepsy among Caribbean coastal Guaymi (57/1000) is considerably greater than that in lower class Panama City populations (22/1000) or in other parts of the world. To identify risk factors for epilepsy, we collected epidemiologic data and serum (for Cysticercus antibody) from subjects with active epilepsy and from 44 age/sex-matched controls. Significantly more cases (47%) than controls (6%) had other family members with epilepsy (relative risk, RR = 14); 44% of cases and 13% of controls reported a history of febrile seizures during childhood (RR = 6)."

Scintigraphic studies of the oropharyngeal transit of a liquid bolus were performed in 15 healthy controls, 12 patients with symptoms of oral-pharyngeal dysphagia, and 13 patients with neuromuscular disease, who did not have dysphagia. Gamma camera imaging of the head, neck, and upper thorax was undertaken, in the lateral projection, during the swallowing of the radiolabeled bolus of water. Inspection of summed images permitted the selection of regions of interest (ROI) to represent the mouth, pharynx, and upper esophagus. Transit times between each ROI were calculated and compared. Significant prolongation of bolus transit time between the mouth and esophagus was present in both patients with and without dysphagia (0.59 +/- 0.38 sec and 0.33 +/- 0.7 sec; mean +/- SD, respectively) compared with controls (0.26 +/- 0.04 sec P less than 0.001, P less than 0.01, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test). Repeat studies in 25 individuals indicated that the transit measurements were more reproducible between swallows in normal subjects than in patients with symptoms.

The authors report the results of a prospective investigation that evaluated postoperative changes in language function after dominant (29 cases) or nondominant (35 cases) anterior temporal lobectomy for treatment of complex partial seizures. These patients received conservative resection of lateral temporal cortex but aggressive resection of medial temporal cortex. None of the patients underwent functional mapping of cortical language ability. All patients were assessed with a standardized aphasia battery (Multilingual Aphasia Examination) before and 6 months after surgery. Postoperatively, the dominant anterior temporal lobectomy group did not show any significant losses in language function compared to patients who underwent nondominant anterior temporal lobectomy. In addition, the dominant temporal lobectomy group showed significant postoperative improvement in complex receptive language comprehension compared to the nondominant group. These results suggest that patients with complex partial seizures of medial temporal lobe onset can undergo a conservative resection of lateral temporal cortex without language mapping. Such surgery carries little risk to language function and provides an excellent postoperative surgical outcome."

CT scanning, extensive exposure, and rigid plate fixation in the setting of the trauma center have permitted early operation with improved results. A subset of patients with facial fractures will also have intracranial injuries (ICI). We sought to identify parameters associated with an increased risk for ICI. We also sought to examine the safety and limits of early craniofacial repair in patients with intracranial injuries. Of 114 mid-face fractures treated over a 1-year period, 43 (38%) had a concomitant ICI. The majority, 36 (84%), were from motor vehicle accidents (MVA). Frontal sinus and orbitoethmoid fractures were at the highest risk for ICI, although orbitozygomatic fractures caused by MVAs also had a surprisingly high incidence of ICI. Our results show that early craniofacial repair can be performed safely with appropriate general surgical and neurosurgical support."

The primary concern of this article is to review experimental methods that may lead to a better understanding of the functional role of the basal ganglia in the control of movement. Two models of basal ganglia impairment are considered: Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. The review focuses primarily on akinesia and bradykinesia because they are key abnormalities of basal ganglia dysfunction. In general, through electromyography and kinematic analysis of movement, it may be possible to characterize specific movement disorders. Specifically, if damage sustained by the central nervous system is traced to a certain structure, it may provide insight on the extent of involvement and functional role of that structure in the control of movement. Much of the data reviewed suggests that the basal ganglia may play a specific role in the initiation and regulation of force control."

    "abstract": "The role of carotid screening before coronary artery bypass. Five hundred thirty-nine patients with no symptoms of cerebral ischemia undergoing coronary artery bypass were preoperatively evaluated for presence of carotid stenosis by noninvasive methods (duplex scanning and ocular pneumoplethysmography-Gee). Overall prevalence of carotid stenosis greater than 75% was higher (8.7%) than that generally reported. Age greater than 60 years was significantly related to presence of carotid stenosis greater than 75% (11.3% vs 3.8%, p = 0.003). Risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking were not predictive for carotid stenosis, postoperative stroke, or death. Carotid stenosis greater than 75% (odds ratio 9.87, p less than 0.005) and coronary artery bypass redo (odds ratio 5.26, p less than 0.05) were both independent predictors of stroke risk. Patients were divided into four groups: group 1, minimal or mild degree of carotid stenosis (less than 50%), not submitted to prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (432 patients, 80.1%); group 2, moderate degree of stenosis (50% to 75%), no prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (60 patients, 11.2%); group 3, severe carotid stenosis; (greater than 75%), submitted to prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (19 patients, 3.5%), group 4, severe carotid stenosis (greater than 75%) no prophylactic carotid endarterectomy (28 patients, 5.2%). Patients in group 4 had significantly higher stroke rate (14.3%) compared to the other three groups (1.1%) (p = 0.0019). The finding of carotid stenosis greater than 75% in patients over 60 years of age was associated with occurrence of stroke in 15% of cases. Carotid screening is helpful to determine patients at increased risk of stroke and should be performed in patients greater than 60 years."

Sleep screening was used to discover the incidence of sleep apnoea in 50 children undergoing routine adenotonsillectomy for recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, randomly selected from the waiting list. Preoperative assessment included a detailed parental history, physical examination, and lateral cephalometry, in order to identify factors that might alert the clinician to a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea. There were 2 equal groups of snorers and non-snorers (grade 0); 1 patient was found to have the sleep apnoea syndrome (IV), 9 patients had obstructive snoring with apnoeic episodes (III), 3 patients had snoring with a disrupted sleep pattern (II), and 12 patients snored with no disruption of sleep (I). In identifying patients with apnoea, a history of snoring was unhelpful, whereas one of breathing irregularities was found to be highly specific. Nasal obstruction correlated poorly; however, there was a significant relationship between tonsillar position and size and sleep grade (Chi-squared P less than 0.01). Stepwise regression analysis showed a large contribution to the grading was made by the size of the oropharyngeal airway measured by lateral cephalometry.

    "abstract": "Bacterial meningitis in neonates and children. A high index of suspicion of meningitis is needed when evaluating neonates and young infants because clinical findings can be minimal and are often subtle and nonspecific. Analysis of the CSF constitutes the most effective method to document meningeal bacterial infection, although overlap with normal CSF values can occur, especially in newborns and very young infants. The introduction of highly active third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) and their safety and efficacy in treating a broad array of bacterial pathogens that cause meningitis in all age groups has simplified selection of initial antibiotic therapy. In neonates, however, conventional antibiotic therapy with ampicillin and an aminoglycoside is appropriate because of its proven record of safety and efficacy, and because routine use of cephalosporins in the hospital nursery could lead to selection of resistant strains among gram-negative enteric bacilli. Despite the availability of modern intensive care management of infants and children with bacterial meningitis and the advent of potent antibiotics, case fatality rates and morbidity remain high. Because of this, recent research has focused on the complex interaction between bacteria and the host and on means to attenuate the meningeal inflammatory response. The clinical benefits demonstrated recently with the use of dexamethasone therapy in infants and children with bacterial meningitis underscore the importance of anti-inflammatory therapy to reduce audiologic and neurologic sequelae. Future studies of new methods to modulate meningeal inflammation such as the use of monoclonal antibodies directed against cytokines or of agents that interfere with leukocyte-endothelial interactions are indicated. The implication of routine H. influenzae type b immunization in young infants with the conjugated vaccines and optimal intrapartum prophylaxis against group B streptococcal disease in newborns will have an important impact on the incidence of meningitis in infants and children."

We reviewed 28 patients with Takayasu's disease to determine the incidence of stroke and its relationship to the involvement of the thoracic aortic arch and its branches. We describe surgical experiences with 10 of the 28 patients who required 21 vascular surgical procedures for critical thoracic aortic arch arterial stenoses, upper and lower extremity ischemia, and renal artery stenoses. Four of the 28 patients initially had a stroke caused by occlusion of one or more thoracic aortic arch arteries. Six of the 10 patients underwent 7 bypass procedures for critical thoracic arch stenoses. All have remained free of stroke for 5 or more years. Four patients had five anastomotic stenoses or graft occlusions in late follow-up; the development of these stenoses did not relate to disease activity at the time of the operative procedure. All bypass grafts originating from the subclavian axillary artery developed anastomotic stenoses; no anastomotic stenoses occurred in bypass grafts originating from the ascending aorta. In contrast to other reports, no anastomotic false aneurysms occurred. Occlusions of major aortic arch arteries in Takayasu's disease cause stroke. Bypass of critically stenoses aortic arch arteries protects against stroke and is best performed with grafts originating from the ascending aorta. Anastomotic stenoses but not anastomotic aneurysms are common. This study suggests that aggressive surgical treatment can be performed with good results."

Cerebral amyloid angiopathy can present as lobar intracerebral hemorrhage in an elderly person, presumably due to increased fragility of the vessels affected by amyloid deposition. For this reason, patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage and suspected of having cerebral amyloid angiopathy have often been treated nonsurgically. Since 1983 we have evaluated 11 patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (nine women and two men, mean age 73 years) who have undergone either intracerebral hematoma evacuation or brain biopsy. Nine of the 11 patients presented with intracerebral hemorrhage, which was unilobar in three patients and multilobar in six and involved the parietal lobes seven times, the frontal lobes four times, the temporal lobes four times, and the occipital lobes twice. These nine patients underwent hematoma removal, with no cases of abnormal intraoperative bleeding or recurrent hemorrhage. Six patients improved neurologically, and two were unchanged after hematoma evacuation; the remaining patient had a fatal cardiopulmonary arrest during the immediate postoperative period. During follow-up in seven patients (median 11 months, range 1 week to 74 months) none experienced a recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage and four continued to improve. Two of the 11 patients had cerebral amyloid angiopathy diagnosed by brain biopsy as part of an evaluation for dementia, also without surgical complications. This series suggests that patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy may safely undergo operative procedures, and patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage may show neurologic improvement following evacuation of the hematoma."

To investigate the effects of focal neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser irradiation (lambda = 1060 nm) on regional cerebral blood flow, cerebral protein synthesis, and blood-brain barrier permeability, the parietal brain surface of 44 rats was irradiated with a focused laser beam at a constant output energy of 30 J. Survival times ranged from 5 minutes to 48 hours. Laser irradiation immediately caused well-defined cortical coagulation necrosis. Within 5 minutes after unilateral irradiation, 14C-iodoantipyrine autoradiographs demonstrated severely reduced blood flow to the irradiation site and perilesional neocortex, but a distinct reactive hyperemia in all other areas of the forebrain. Apart from a persistent ischemic focus in the vicinity of the cortical coagulation necrosis, blood flow alterations in remote areas of the brain subsided within 3 hours after irradiation. Autoradiographic assessment of 3H-tyrosine incorporation into brain proteins revealed rapid onset and prolonged duration of protein synthesis inhibition in perifocal morphologically intact cortical and subcortical structures. Impairment of amino acid incorporation proved to be completely reversible within 48 hours. Immunoautoradiographic visualization of extravasated plasma proteins using 3H-labeled rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulins-showed that, up to 1 hour after irradiation, immunoreactive proteins were confined to the neocortex at the irradiation site. At 4 hours, vasogenic edema was present in the vicinity of the irradiation site and the subcortical white matter, and, at later stages (16 to 36 hours), also extended into the contralateral hemisphere. Although this was followed by a gradual decrease in labeling intensity, resolution of edema was still not complete after 48 hours. Analysis of sequential functional changes in conjunction with morphological alterations indicates that the evolution of morphological damage after laser irradiation does not correlate with the time course and spatial distribution of protein synthesis inhibition or vasogenic edema. Although the central coagulation necrosis represents a direct effect of radiation, the final size of the laser-induced lesion is determined by a delayed colliquation necrosis due to persistent perifocal ischemia. Extent and severity of ischemia in a zone with initial preservation of neuroglial cells can be explained by the optical properties of the Nd:YAG laser; extensive scattering of light within brain parenchyma associated with a high blood-to-brain absorption ratio selectively affects blood vessels outside the irradiation focus."

To characterize ventilatory responses to bronchoconstriction during sleep and to assess the effect of prior sleep deprivation on ventilatory and arousal responses to bronchoconstriction, bronchoconstriction was induced in eight asthmatic subjects while they were awake, during normal sleep, and during sleep after a 36-h period of sleep deprivation. Each subject was bronchoconstricted with increasing concentrations of aerosolized methacholine while ventilatory patterns and lower airway resistance (Rla) were continually monitored. The asthmatic patients maintained their minute ventilation as Rla increased under all conditions, demonstrating a stable tidal volume with a mild increase in respiratory frequency. Inspiratory drive, as measured by occlusion pressure (P0.1), increased progressively and significantly as Rla increased under all conditions (slopes of P0.1 vs. Rla = 0.249, 0.112, and 0.154 for awake, normal sleep, and sleep after sleep deprivation, respectively, P less than 0.0006). Chemostimuli did not appear to contribute significantly to the observed increases in P0.1. Prior sleep deprivation had no effect on ventilatory and P0.1 responses to bronchoconstriction but did significantly raise the arousal threshold to induced bronchoconstriction. We conclude that ventilatory responses to bronchoconstriction, unlike extrinsic loading, are not imparied by the presence of sleep, nor are they chemically mediated. However, prior sleep deprivation does increase the subsequent arousal threshold."

The proportion of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) who are considered demented ranges from 10% to 15%. Because dementia may affect survival in PD, the incidence rate of dementia, rather than proportion, would be a more accurate measure of disease frequency. We previously estimated the proportion of patients with PD and dementia to be 10.9% from the records of a cohort with the idiopathic form of PD in a major medical center. We reviewed the clinical records of this cohort after 4 years and 9 months to estimate the incidence rate of dementia. We identified 65 new cases of dementia from the 249 patient-records available. Using the number of person-years of follow-up for each case as the denominator, we estimated the overall incidence rate to be 69 per 1,000 person-years of observation. The mean age of this cohort was 71.4 years. The cumulative incidence of dementia increased with age. By 85 years of age, over 65% of the surviving members of the cohort were demented. The age-specific incidence rates for dementia in this cohort of PD were significantly greater than for a similarly aged cohort of healthy elderly people. The age-specific standard morbidity ratios indicated that, compared with people of similar ages, patients with PD have the highest increase in risk for dementia between ages 65 and 75."

In conclusion, we report the cases of two patients with large hemangiomas of the liver, abdominal pain, increased ESR and fibrinogen, increased serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase activity, and normal white blood cell counts. Clinical and biochemical abnormalities disappeared after surgical resection. Increased ESR and fibrinogen are probably related to thrombosis within the tumor. This mode of presentation may suggest a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma."

    "abstract": "Measurement of progressive cerebral ventriculomegaly in infants after grades III and IV intraventricular hemorrhages. To develop guidelines that might help predict prospectively which infants with severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) would require intervention, we obtained serial cranial sonograms to measure the rate of growth of cerebral ventricular volumes in 48 preterm infants with and without IVH. The infants were divided into three groups: (1) those with no IVH (22 infants), (2) those with IVH with acute ventricular dilation (13 infants), and (3) those with IVH with progressive ventricular dilation requiring intervention (13 infants). The decision to intervene because of progressive ventricular dilation was based on clinical criteria and the subjective assessment of increasing ventricular size on weekly cranial sonograms. The rate of cerebral ventricular volume growth in infants with IVH who needed intervention was greater (4.2 +/- 3.3 ml/day) than that in infants without IVH (0.0 +/- 0.1 ml/day; p less than 0.001) and in infants with IVH and acute ventricular dilation (0.0 +/- 0.2 ml/day; p less than 0.001). Using these data, we generated guidelines for predicting prospectively which infants with IVH and ventricular dilation will need intervention for posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. The guidelines were then confirmed prospectively in 10 infants."

    "abstract": "Neuroophthalmologic effects of intravenous magnesium sulfate. To test the hypothesis that visual disturbances are more common during intravenous magnesium sulfate administration than at 1 to 4 days after discontinuation of the drug, 13 women underwent bedside neuroophthalmologic examinations during intravenous magnesium sulfate tocolysis at 2.0 to 3.0 gm hr and again at 1 to 4 days after cessation of therapy. Visual symptoms were common during intravenous magnesium sulfate administration. Blurred vision was present in 12 of 13 patients and diplopia was present in 10 of 13 patients. Abnormal findings during neuroophthalmologic examination occurred in all patients during intravenous magnesium sulfate administration. Findings included ptosis, accommodative and convergence insufficiency, and abnormal pupillary responsiveness to light and near. All patients were symptom-free and had normal examinations after magnesium sulfate was discontinued. These findings suggest that visual disturbances with therapeutic magnesium sulfate are common."

We describe the diagnostic procedures and surgical approaches employed in 5 patients with dumbbell tumors of the mediastinum. Magnetic resonance imaging accurately described the existence and longitudinal extension of the intraspinal component of the tumor and assisted in choosing the appropriate surgical approach. Both the intrathoracic and intraspinal components of the tumor were resected at one time by a thoracic and neurosurgical team. We employed the Grillo technique three times and a separate laminectomy and thoracotomy approach. Magnetic resonance imaging proved the most useful diagnostic technique for suspected dumbbell mediastinal tumors. In our experience, the extended thoracotomy proposed by Grillo and co-workers worked well for small tumors involving only one foramen in which the intraspinal extension was limited to 2 to 3 cm, and when no more than two laminectomies were required. On the other hand, thoracotomy and a longitudinal paravertebral incision are preferable for larger tumors (more than 4 cm) involving more than one foramen in which the intraspinal extension exceeds 2 to 3 cm, for tumors requiring multiple laminectomy, and when bony infiltration is present."

    "abstract": "The effect of nightly nasal CPAP treatment on underlying obstructive sleep apnea and pharyngeal size. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). It is usually prescribed for nightly use; however, recent studies show that patients often do not wear the appliance consistently. Previous studies have also suggested that nasal CPAP may improve a patient's underlying OSA even when the mask is not in place. We investigated 12 men with OSA to see if nasal CPAP used nightly for six weeks would improve their underlying sleep-disordered breathing. We also studied pharyngeal volumes measured using magnetic resonance imaging and a computer-controlled digitizing pad. Patients with more severe OSA had improvement after six weeks; however, they still demonstrated significant OSA. Patients with less severe OSA did not have significant change. We were unable to show a significant difference in any patient's awake pharyngeal volumes. We conclude that patients with OSA should be encouraged to wear their nasal CPAP machines regularly."

    "abstract": "Assessing clinical significance of apnea exceeding fifteen seconds with event recording. Using event recording, we determined how often apnea exceeding 15 seconds in duration was associated with bradycardia and how often patients with apnea resumed breathing spontaneously. Of 1306 documented apnea events exceeding 15 seconds (54 patients), 926 lasted 16 to 20 seconds, 262 lasted 21 to 25 seconds, and 118 exceeded 25 seconds. Of these episodes, 75.3% were isolated and 14.9% were associated with pulse deceleration, 4.4% with irregular transthoracic impedance, and 5.4% with bradycardia. Event recording provided data supporting discontinuation of monitoring in 50 of 54 patients: 36 spontaneously resumed breathing before the auditory alarm and 14 had a decreased incidence of apnea with maturation. Follow-up of 51 patients (three not located) showed that none had subsequent apparent life-threatening events or sudden infant death syndrome. Our results in these older infants and children (median age 6.7 months) provide substantiation that such patients with apnea of less than 20 seconds without bradycardia do not require continued monitoring. Further, these data suggest that in selected older infants, longer isolated apnea may be well tolerated; however, hemoglobin saturation during sleep and the ability to resume breathing after the apnea alarm delay is prolonged should be verified. Our patient population had a wide age range and heterogeneity of diagnoses, and was typically free of symptoms, so these results should not be extrapolated uncritically to premature infants, infants with chronic lung disease, and patients with symptomatic apnea."

As effective antipsychotic pharmacotherapy has become available, patients with schizophrenia are increasingly managed in an outpatient setting by primary care physicians. Pharmacotherapy is generally effective in treating \"positive,\" or psychotic, symptoms and lessening the risks of relapse, but ineffective in improving \"negative,\" or deficit, symptoms. Aggressive attempts to totally control positive symptoms and to ameliorate negative symptoms tend to increase side effects and may be detrimental to the patient. Intensive psychotherapeutic and rehabilitative approaches are generally unproductive. Attempting to obtain a cure is unrealistic. A moderate approach is recommended, taking into consideration the limitations of existing treatments, achieving control of extreme symptoms and minimizing social and occupational limitations."

The single-stage commissurotomy in all four patients included the anterior commissures and two-thirds or four-fifths section of the corpus callosum with sparing of the splenium. There was no demonstrable ability to transfer hand posture in these patients. This was the major evidence for functional deconnexion. A newly learned task of one-hand knotting revealed right hand impairment in all four patients. There was no dyspraxia in the right hand for over-learned object-handling tasks in these patients. It is suggested that there might be right hemisphere specialisation for the initial acquisition of unimanual object-handling skills and that the spared callosal fibres in the splenium alone are insufficient to mediate task control under these conditions. This is supported by the finding that one of these patients, who was the only one who had a right parietal lesion, was unable to perform the newly learned task with either hand."

We compared whole blood platelet aggregation, adenosine triphosphate release, platelet count, platelet crit (percentage volume of platelets), and mean platelet volume during the acute, subacute, and chronic periods of cerebral thrombosis in 22 patients with value in 29 controls. During the acute and subacute periods, platelet aggregation, platelet count, platelet crit, and mean platelet volume were significantly less in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.05-0.01) while the adenosine triphosphate release rate per volume of platelets was significantly greater (p less than 0.05). During the acute period, infarct size showed a significant positive correlation with platelet aggregation (r = 0.59, p less than 0.01) and adenosine triphosphate release rate (r = 0.70, p less than 0.001) but a negative correlation with platelet count (r = -0.44, p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that platelet aggregation is reduced during the acute period due to the consumption of platelets during thrombogenesis but that the remaining individual platelets are hyperactive. Platelet consumption during the acute period increases with infarct size. During the chronic period, platelet crit and mean platelet volume were significantly less in the patients than in the controls (p less than 0.01) while the adenosine triphosphate release rate was significantly greater (p less than 0.01), suggesting sustained platelet consumption and chronically enhanced secretion of individual platelets."

The sex ratios and ages were not significantly different in the 3 groups. The planimetric measurements and calculated indices of cerebral atrophy were significantly different in the habitual cocaine abusers compared with the 2 other groups of patients. There were no differences between 1st-time cocaine users and controls. Among the habitual cocaine abusers there was a positive correlation between the approximate duration of cocaine abuse and the calculated atrophy indices. The findings suggest that cerebral atrophy develops in chronic cocaine abusers, and the severity correlates with the duration of abuse."

On the contralateral side, the last three components were also present. The second component was different from the normal R2 response in that its latency was shorter than normal and it did not habituate by stimulation at a rate of 10 Hz. In addition, it was more affected by diazepam than the third or fourth components.

Felbamate (FBM) is a novel antiepileptic drug (AED) currently undergoing clinical evaluation in the United States. During a controlled clinical trial conducted at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, FBM was added to constant carbamazepine (CBZ) monotherapy. CBZ total concentrations were reduced during active FBM treatment (mean reduction 25%, range 10-42%, p less than 0.001). The effect was evident after the first week of treatment and reached a plateau in 2-4 weeks. To clarify the interaction mechanism, free and total concentrations of CBZ and its plasma metabolites were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultrafiltration in four patients. In these patients, FBM treatment reduced CBZ concentrations and increased CBZ-epoxide (CBZ-E) concentrations (p less than 0.01). Free fractions of all compounds were unmodified. FBM appears to be capable of inducing CBZ metabolism. CBZ-FBM interaction may be clinically relevant."

Tumor shrinkage was achieved by radiating the tumor surface with the Nd:YAG-laser. This technique facilitated the microsurgical dissection and reduced the blood loss by half. The Nd:YAG-laser necrotization of the dural and bony attachments reduced the recurrence rate following grade two resections from 20% to zero.

The effects of the cholecystokinin antagonist devazepide on analgesia and respiratory depression induced by morphine in squirrel monkeys were examined. Pain thresholds were determined using the tail withdrawal procedure, in which monkeys restrained in chairs kept their tails in cool (35 degrees C) water for at least 20 sec, but withdrew them from warm (55 degrees C) water in less than 4 sec. Morphine produced a dose-related increase in tail withdrawal latencies from warm water. Devazepide (injected i.p. or p.o.) had no effect on tail withdrawal latencies when given alone but enhanced the analgesic effects of morphine. The devazepide dose-response curve for morphine enhancement was bell-shaped with doses of 3, 10, 30 and 100 micrograms/kg injected i.p. increasing morphine analgesia whereas higher and lower dose did not. In a separate group of monkeys, morphine produced dose-dependent decreases in respiratory rate and oxygen tension and increases in carbon dioxide tension. In contrast to its effects on morphine analgesia, devazepide had no effect on the various indices of morphine-induced respiratory depression. These data suggest that devazepide may have therapeutic utility as an adjuvant to morphine analgesia allowing lower dose of the opiate to be used to relieve pain and reducing the risk of opiate-induced respiratory depression."

The authors illustrate a new method to identify the pre- and postcentral gyri on computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain on the basis of the pattern of the medullary branches of the cerebral white matter. The most commonly used method to identify the gyri depends on recognition of the central sulcus by surface arrangement of the sulci. The two methods were compared by analysis of CT images of 104 subjects who had normal findings (age range, newborn to 60 years; 57 males and 47 females). The usefulness of the new method was also determined in angiographic studies of nine patients with space-occupying lesions. The method is especially helpful for identification of gyri on the lower level of the centrum semiovale and if space-occupying lesions are present that may result in a blurred depiction of sulci. Since MR imaging depicts the medullary branches more clearly than does CT, this new method should facilitate identification of the gyri with either modality."

The ED50 and ED90 values for suxamethonium were 0.08 mg/kg and 0.20 mg/kg, and an infusion rate of 3.2 mg/kg/hour was required to maintain a 90-95% depression of the single twitch response as monitored by integrated electromyography.

Although most patients with hydrocephalus are treated effectively with ventriculoperitoneal shunts, a small group fails to respond to diversion procedures. In some patients within this group, hydrocephalus may be caused in part by the overproduction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In other patients, previous shunt infections may limit the ability of the peritoneum to absorb fluid, and patient response to a ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be improved by reducing CSF production. We discuss a case of a 29-month-old hydrocephalic infant with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt who had ascites. Computed tomography showed bilateral symmetrical enlargement of the choroid plexus. Repeated cultures of the CSF and shunt tubing were sterile, and the daily production of the CSF exceeded 1000 ml. Therapy with acetazolamide decreased the CSF output temporarily, but it was discontinued after serious electrolyte abnormalities occurred. The endoscopic coagulation of the choroid plexus with a neodymium:YAG laser transmitted through a flexible quartz fiber decreased CSF production effectively. This procedure may be useful in a variety of clinical conditions associated with hydrocephalus or with other intraventricular lesions."

Dosage was increased in response to the circulating AED concentration in 12% of consultations and decreased in another 7.5%. Unsuspected poor compliance was uncovered in eight patients, and in three others an AED was added or discontinued on the basis of the assay result. The time of the next appointment was rearranged in 58 attendances. Only 50% of results were in the \"therapeutic\" ranges for the four major AEDs. Dosage was adjusted (50 up, 16 down) after 54% of low results. \"Therapeutic\" levels were followed by a change in AED dose (52 up, 31 down) in 26%. Only 29% of concentrations above the \"therapeutic\" range persuaded the doctor to alter the dosage regimen, and in 20% of these an increase in dose was recommended. On-site AED monitoring had an immediate impact on clinical decision-making in greater than 23% of consultations but in a form more subtle than the simple quest for a therapeutic result."

Eighty seven preterm infants with no evidence of intracranial disease and good neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years formed the control group. A poor outcome was observed in infants in group B, C, and D, particularly in those who had persistent dilated ventricles at 6 weeks postnatal age and extensive periventricular leukomalacia. There was no difference in outcome between group A and controls. During the first six weeks of life ventricular area growth velocities were significantly higher in groups B, C, D, compared with normal controls and group A. We suggest that persistent ventricular dilatation at this early stage carries a bad prognosis, which is the result of atrophy of the brain."

It is also markedly improved compared with a combined fetal survival rate of 16% among 48 previously reported pregnancies with the stuck twin phenomenon managed without serial amniocenteses (p less than 0.0001). Survival correlated with the absence of concomitant pregnancy complications (i.e., maternal hypertension or intractable labor) and with the absence of severe fetal structural abnormalities.

One patient had nearly complete loss of ventilation involving both automatic and voluntary components. He showed no ventilator response during a CO2 retention test (PaCO2 62 mm Hg, PaO2 82 mm Hg), while consciousness was preserved until death. The infarct involved the reticular formation, nucleus tractus solitarius, nucleus ambiguus, and nucleus retroambiguus on the right but spared the dorsal motor nucleus of the tenth cranial nerve, and sensory and corticospinal tracts. The second patient showed hypoventilation more selectively involving automatic responses (Ondine's curse). The infarct involved the medullary reticular formation and nucleus ambiguus but spared the nucleus tractus solitarius. We suggest that unilateral involvement of pontomedullary reticular formation and nucleus ambiguus is sufficient for generating loss of automatic respiration, while associated lesion of the nucleus tractus solitarius may lead to more severe respiratory failure involving both automatic and voluntary responses."

We identified the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by specific radioimmunoassays in the CSF of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurologic diseases (OND). There was a high incidence of detectable IL-1 beta in patients with active MS compared with inactive MS or OND patients. TNF was also more frequently present in active MS than in OND CSF. By contrast, most MS CSF did not contain detectable IL-6. There was no correlation between the degree of CSF pleocytosis and the level of individual cytokines, suggesting that cytokine accumulations may be derived from CNS, and not CSF, cells. As IL-1 beta and TNF experimentally induce astrogliosis, demyelination, temperature elevation, lassitude, and sleep, and results raise the possibility that these cytokines may contribute to a variety of manifestations in MS and in other disease states."

    "abstract": "Oxidation reactions in Parkinson's disease. Free radicals generated from oxidation reactions may contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). Free radicals are capable of reacting almost instantaneously with membrane lipids and causing lipid peroxidation, membrane injury, and cell death. Dopamine is metabolized by oxidation reactions capable of generating free radicals. Recent evidence indicates that the substantia nigra of patients with PD contains increased iron, which enhances oxidation, and decreased glutathione, which protects against the formation of free radicals. Further, the end products of lipid peroxidation are increased in the substantia nigra of patients with PD, supporting the notions that free radicals are being generated and may contribute to dopamine neuronal death. This hypothesis suggests that antioxidant therapies may slow the rate of progression of PD and raises concern that metabolites of levodopa therapy may accelerate the rate of neuronal degeneration."

    "abstract": "Tourette syndrome: recent advances. Clinical and genetic studies have allowed the limits of Tourette syndrome to be broadened. There is now strong evidence that chronic motor tics and Tourette syndrome are different manifestations of an autosomal dominant gene with high penetrance. A genetic link with obsessive-compulsive disorder also appears to have been established. Up to 10% of cases of Tourette syndrome may be nongenetic phenocopies, however. There is also an association between Tourette syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This complicates therapy, as psychostimulant drugs may precipitate or exacerbate tics in some individuals. A high proportion of patients with Tourette syndrome also has neuropsychological deficits and learning disabilities. The pathophysiology is incompletely understood. The best supported hypothesis is that there is dopamine receptor supersensitivity, although there are strong suggestions of abnormalities in serotonin metabolism. The possibility of abnormalities in neuropeptide systems is being explored. Treatment of tics relies primarily on neuroleptics with dopamine receptor blocking activity. Clonidine may be useful in some patients, especially those with behavior problems. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms can be treated using appropriate pharmacologic agents. The treatment of attention deficit disorder in patients with tics should begin with behavioral strategies. Clonidine can be tried as the first-line drug, and psychostimulants should be used only if necessary and with great caution. In rare instances it may be necessary to combine a psychostimulant and a neuroleptic."

    "abstract": "Serum aldolase isozyme levels in patients with cerebrovascular diseases. A subunit specific radioimmunoassay was developed for the quantification of human aldolase A, B, and C. The method used was a double antibody radioimmunoassay using radioiodinated purified aldolase A, B, or C subunits as the ligand, specific chicken antibodies to aldolase isozymes and rabbit antibodies to chicken IgG. The Iodogen method was used for iodination of the purified isozyme subunits in this study. Human brain tissue contained similar concentrations of aldolase A and aldolase C, and a smaller amount of aldolase B, which was the main isozyme of liver tissue. Levels of serum aldolase A were greater than 203 ng/ml, the upper limit of normal, in six of 24 patients with cerebral infarction and in 11 of 31 patients with cerebral hemorrhage. Nine of 24 patients with cerebral infarction and 16 of 31 patients with cerebral hemorrhage had serum aldolase C levels greater than 4.1 ng/ml, the upper limit in normal sera. These data suggest that serum aldolase C may be a more specific and sensitive marker of cerebrovascular diseases than aldolase A. We also demonstrated that serial measurement of serum aldolase C in patients with cerebrovascular diseases might be useful in estimating prognosis, since serially increasing serum aldolase C levels during the course of these diseases were correlated with a high mortality rate."

It was recorded in healthy volunteers (n = 8) and in patients suffering from migraine without (n = 12) or with (n = 5) aura, during one (CNV1) and three second (CNV3) foreperiods in a forewarned reaction time task. CNV1 was recorded at the vertex while CNV3 was recorded at multiple electrode sites to assess topographical differences. Seven out of twelve migraine patients without aura had increased CNV1 amplitudes. CNV3 amplitudes were increased as well, but only at electrode positions C3 and C4 and not at Fz. CNV3, which allows for analysis of both an early and a late CNV component, could improve the discrimination of migraine without aura beyond that of CNV1. In migraine with aura all CNV parameters were at control levels, confirming previous results. The data obtained are discussed in terms of arousal, activation and stress and the \"biobehavioral model of migraine\" (Welch, 1986)."

Sixty-five families were enlisted in a study exploring factors associated with distress behavior in 5-year-old children receiving diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis immunizations. At a home visit 1 month before the immunization, the following measures were obtained: (1) the Behavioral Style Questionnaire, a measure of temperament: (2) parental self-reports of medically related attributes (eg. \"good patient\"); (3) parental attitudes toward pain in children and responsiveness to their child's pain; and (4) parental prediction of distress at upcoming immunization. The child's distress behavior during the immunization was evaluated using a modification of the Procedure Rating Scale-Revised and, after the procedure, the child's assessment of his or her pain was elicited using the Oucher. Children's mean Procedure Rating Scale-Revised score was 2.57 of a possible 11. Thirty-one (48%) had low (less than or equal to 1) and 7 (11%) had high distress scores (greater than or equal to 2 SD above the mean). Factors positively correlated with distressed behavior included more \"difficult child\" cluster characteristics, the individual temperamental dimension of adaptability, but few parental attitudes and attributes. Parent's predictions of distress were the strongest correlates. These findings document the variation that children demonstrate in response to pain and offer some insight into associated innate and environmental factors. These results imply that treatment strategies derived from parental knowledge and tailored to individual characteristics of the child may be most effective in alleviating pain-related distress in medical settings."

Functional changes of various neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. In this study the role of brain monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems in hepatic encephalopathy was investigated in rats with thioacetamide-induced acute liver failure. Concentrations of serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline and of their metabolites 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, dihydroxyphenylalanine (following inhibition of dihydroxyphenylalanine-decarboxylase), dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl-glycol, were measured in the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. In hepatic encephalopathy concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were increased in all three brain areas (196%, 204% and 264% of saline-treated controls, p less than 0.01), and concentrations of serotonin were increased in the frontal cortex (121%, p less than 0.01). In the frontal cortex and hippocampus of encephalopathic rats dopamine levels were increased (157% and 289%, p less than 0.05), and levels of noradrenaline (53% and 46%, p less than 0.05) were decreased associated with increased 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol levels (173% and 206%, p less than 0.05). The extent of these changes correlated with the stage of hepatic encephalopathy. In hepatic encephalopathy dihydroxyphenylalanine accumulation was increased in the hippocampus and unchanged in the cerebral cortex. Dopamine, noradrenaline, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid concentrations were unchanged in the striatum. The results of this study indicate that hepatic encephalopathy in thioacetamide-induced acute liver failure in rats is associated with neurochemical changes, suggesting an increased activity of the noradrenergic and serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems."

We studied 20 patients, 14 with major unilateral cerebral infarctions in the middle cerebral or internal carotid territories; four with a single lacune in the pons, internal capsule, or thalamus; and two with precentral infarcts. Using somatosensory evoked potentials, motor conduction studies, and assessments of conduction across the plexus and roots, we detected no conduction abnormalities on the affected side. Fibrillation was common in both groups, especially in distal and intermediate muscles. The distribution of the fibrillation and the normal conduction studies suggested that trauma of peripheral nerves was not a factor. Although the normal conduction studies and pattern of fibrillation activity do not exclude peripheral nerve trauma as the cause of the fibrillation, we suggest that transsynaptic degeneration is a reasonable alternative explanation."

Reconstruction of bony structures of the face is always a problem as big as the defect and the function that must be replaced.

Based on the studies of Cutting et al., Psillakis et al., and Casanova et al., we have developed the full-thickness galeoparietal bone flap, initially for mandibular reconstruction, but of great use for all maxillofacial reconstructions. From July of 1987 to December of 1988, 14 patients have been operated on. The experience with this flap is shown in four patients as follows: primary reconstruction of a mandible as a result of ameloblastoma, secondary reconstruction of a mandible with associated old fractures and malalignment of segments, bilateral malar reconstruction in a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome, and severe sequelae of an already treated Romberg case. Small variations could be made to best accommodate the technique used to the defect we were treating. Some technical details, the experience, the results, and possible sequelae or complications are also discussed."

The effect of sleep on the involuntary movements or dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, primary and secondary torsion dystonia, and Gilles de la Tourette syndrome was studied in a total of 52 patients and 10 normal subjects using video electroencephalographic telemetry. Movements typical of the wake pattern were seen occasionally during unequivocal sleep in all but two completed studies, and in each condition reappeared under similar circumstances. The movements were most likely to occur after awakenings or lightenings of sleep, or in stage one sleep. The movements were very rare during the deeper phases of sleep. Those movements that occurred during sleep without awakenings were usually preceded by arousal phenomena and, rarely, by sleep spindles or slow waves. The control group showed normal \"semipurposeful\" movements under the same conditions during sleep. The rare appearance of the different dyskinesias and normal movements under similar circumstances during sleep could be a result of common effects on the generator systems or changes in the excitability of the final common motor pathway."

The problem is to determine whether the presence of several peaks represents the coexistence of separate tremor mechanisms or be a consequence of fluctuations in the frequency or amplitude of a single tremor. The spectrum of a tremor whose frequency or amplitude vary and are independent has the recognisable pattern of a central carrier frequency with sidebands of equal amplitudes distributed symmetrically around the carrier. However, if tremor amplitude and frequency fluctuate and are not independent, (frequency proportional to amplitude or frequency inversely proportional to amplitude), the spectrum has a pattern of sidebands which are asymmetrical in amplitudes and may resemble the spectrum of the combined signal from different independent oscillators. The investigation of sidebands in spectra has been neglected in tremor studies and multiple irregular peaks on a tremor spectrum have sometimes been used wrongly as evidence for the coexistence of multiple tremor mechanisms or frequency components assumed to be concurrent."

Infant vocal babbling has been assumed to be a speech-based phenomenon that reflects the maturation of the articulatory apparatus responsible for spoken language production. Manual babbling has now been reported to occur in deaf children exposed to signed languages from birth. The similarities between manual and vocal babbling suggest that babbling is a product of an amodal, brain-based language capacity under maturational control, in which phonetic and syllabic units are produced by the infant as a first step toward building a mature linguistic system. Contrary to prevailing accounts of the neurological basis of babbling in language ontogeny, the speech modality is not critical in babbling. Rather, babbling is tied to the abstract linguistic structure of language and to an expressive capacity capable of processing different types of signals (signed or spoken)."

A distinct pattern of neuropsychological deficits was associated with low homovanillic acid (HVA) in the cerebrospinal fluid of 21 patients with: Alzheimer's disease (9), Parkinson's disease (8) and major depressive disorders (4). Regardless of clinical diagnosis, patients with low HVA were slower on a test of efficiency of processing timed information, and showed greater benefit from semantic structure on a verbal fluency task than patients with high HVA. However, low HVA subjects were not significantly impaired on confrontation naming (Boston Naming Test). Across three diagnostic groups, patients with lower HVA also tended to have more extrapyramidal motor signs and were significantly more depressed. These results demonstrate a significant relationship between specific neuro-behavioural deficits and dopaminergic activity which cuts across traditional diagnostic categories."

Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The disease was correctly diagnosed within 2 years of the onset in 80% of cases. Onset of symptoms peaked in the second and third decade in females and fell between 20 and 59 years in males. At first observation 87% of the patients had generalized MG. Maximal worsening was observed within 3 years in 77% of patients. At the last follow-up, 35% of cases were symptom-free (pharmacological remission 24%, remission without treatment 11%). The more severe the disease at the first observation and at the maximal worsening of symptoms, the lower was the proportion of remissions. Steroids were given in 54% and immunosuppressants in 18%. Thymectomy was performed in 72%, mostly in women, younger than age 40, and with generalized MG. Thymectomy seemed to improve the course of the disease, mostly in patients operated on shortly after diagnosis and those with generalized mild-to-moderate disease and with a normally involuted thymus.

A clinical sample of 19 school-aged native children diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) or fetal alcohol effects (FAE) was compared with age- and sex-matched normal controls. Results on a battery of intellectual and neuropsychological tests indicated large and significant differences between alcohol-affected children and controls. FAS differed significantly from controls on measures of intellectual abilities, while FAE did not; FAS mean scores on these measures were significantly lower than FAE means. For neuropsychological measures, FAS were significantly poorer than controls on most measures, while FAE showed deficits compared with controls only on grip strength. The results suggest that neuropsychological measures would be a valuable supplement to intellectual measures for the purpose of assessing alcohol effects because they are less vulnerable than intellectual measures to the influence of cultural and educational experiences."

Glutamate contents were low in frontal cortex and thalamus, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) contents were low in thalamus and substantia nigra of both patients. In addition, phosphoethanolamine contents were reduced in all brain regions of both patients, especially in the substantia nigra. One patient with severe symptoms had low levels of homovanillic acid, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and GABA in his CSF repeatedly for 3 years before death (aged 58), while the 2nd patient died (aged 51) of an unrelated cause before developing any symptoms of the familial disorder.

Twenty-one of the 23 patients had abnormalities on SPECT scanning consisting of areas of decreased activity reflecting diminished cerebral blood flow. In 15 of these 21 patients, there was good correlation between the site of the abnormality on SPECT scan and the site of origin of seizures monitored by EEG. Of the six remaining patients, four had multifocal SPECT abnormalities, with one of the abnormal areas corresponding with an ictal site. The two remaining patients had SPECT abnormalities and major ictal EEG foci in entirely different areas. In contrast to the high proportion of abnormal SPECT scans, only 10 of 23 focal abnormalities were discovered on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Three patients who had seizures within 2 h of an initial scan were rescanned 4-5 h after injection. Focal areas of increased blood flow were noted on all three scans, although not always at the ictal site. The SPECT scan appears to be useful in interictal localization of seizure foci. Postictal scans may also be useful, although our numbers are too small to draw conclusions."

We sought to determine whether high spatial resolution magnetic resonance imaging is useful for noninvasive quantitation of the ischemic infarct produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery and for detection of reduced infarct volume elicited by electric stimulation of the cerebellar fastigial nucleus. Male rats of the spontaneously hypertensive strain were anesthetized, the middle cerebral artery was occluded, and the fastigial nucleus was stimulated for 1 hour. Twenty-four hours later, rats were reanesthetized and T1- and T2-weighted images were obtained. Rats were killed and the volume and distribution of the lesion was established by histopathology. Magnetic resonance imaging estimates of the lesion volume were 271 +/- 41.0 mm3 (middle cerebral artery, n = 5) and 148 +/- 8.4 mm3 (middle cerebral artery + fastigial nucleus stimulation, n = 6; 45% reduction, p less than 0.05). Histopathological analysis revealed a lesion of 229.8 +/- 15.4 mm3 involving somatosensory cortex, lateral caudate putamen, and lateral hippocampus. Fastigial nucleus stimulation resulted in a 36% reduction in infarct volume to 146.0 +/- 10.3 mm3. The retrieved zone was largely in the cortex dorsal and ventral to the lesion and mostly posterior to the lesion. The estimates of lesion volume by magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology did not differ and were highly correlated (r = 0.90; p less than 0.001). This study confirms our previous finding that fastigial nucleus stimulation reduces the volume of a focal ischemic infarct and demonstrates that magnetic resonance imaging not only accurately estimates the volume of the lesion but also can detect changes as small as 50-100 mm3."

Appearance thresholds obtained by linear ramps increasing at a rate less than 4.15 microns/sec provided accurate and repeatable thresholds compared with thresholds obtained by forced-choice testing. These rates would be acceptable if only sensitive sites were studied, but they were too slow for use in automatic testing of insensitive parts. Appearance thresholds obtained by fast linear rates (4.15 or 16.6 microns/sec) overestimated threshold, especially for sensitive parts. Use of the mean of appearance and disappearance thresholds, with the stimulus increasing exponentially at rates of 0.5 or 1.0 just noticeable difference (JND) units per second, and interspersion of null stimuli, Bekesy with null stimuli, provided accurate, repeatable, and fast estimates of threshold for sensitive parts. Despite the good performance of Bekesy testing, we prefer forced choice for evaluation of the sensation of patients with neuropathy."

Sixty three (89%) were followed to the end of the study or death, mean follow up time was 5.3 years. Whilst twenty (28%) had diabetes or hypertension, in thirty nine (55%) no predisposing condition was identified. In those who had monocular disease at presentation (68), subsequent involvement of the second eye occurred in seventeen (25%), seven within the first year. Nineteen patients died within the study period. Of these, nine died from myocardial infarction and four from cerebrovascular disease. This is a significant increase above figures calculated from the Office of Population Census and Surveys (p less than 0.001 for all causes, p less than 0.002 for myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular disease). Such an increase in mortality has not been previously reported, and implies that this condition carries a more sinister systemic prognosis than is frequently supposed."

    "abstract": "Fungal meningitis. Fungal meningitis tends to be a subacute or chronic process; however, it may be just as lethal as bacterial meningitis if untreated. There are many similarities between the pathogenic fungi. Most of the fungi are aerosolized and inhaled, and initiate a primary pulmonary infection which is usually self-limited. Hematogenous dissemination may follow the initial infection, with subsequent involvement of the CNS. Rarely, trauma or local extension provides the route to CNS infection. The host is frequently, although not always, immunosuppressed. The hyphae of molds generally cause focal disease with hemorrhagic necrosis secondary to vascular thrombosis. The yeasts tend to cause a more diffuse process with the base of the brain being primarily affected, such that hydrocephalus is seen as a frequent complication of chronic disease. Diagnosis may be difficult, as the CSF may be normal, with negative smears and sterile cultures, although more often there is at least one abnormality indicating disease. Serologies (if available, depending on the fungus) may point towards the proper diagnosis, as may a careful travel history. Currently, amphotericin B is still the drug of choice in most situations; however, the newer azole antifungal agents offer great promise, especially in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. The precise role of such agents will remain unclear until appropriate large-scale studies of their effectiveness have been completed. The treatment of the unusual CNS mycoses will continue to be based on clinical experience, and reports of the use of new azoles in these diseases need to be critically evaluated."

Fifty-nine elderly residents of long-term care facilities who had DSM-III diagnoses of dementia were studied in an 8-week randomized, double-blind comparison trial of haloperidol, oxazepam, and diphenhydramine to test the efficacy of these agents in the treatment of clinically significant behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. All three agents demonstrated modest but significant efficacy as measured by clinician ratings of agitated behavior and activities of daily living. The absolute magnitude of improvement was greater for haloperidol and diphenhydramine than for oxazepam, but differences among groups did not approach statistical significance. Frequencies of acute adverse events during the trial were similar across the drug treatment groups. Although these drugs may differ in terms of long-term safety and efficacy, they appear to be equivalent for short-term management of agitated behavior in severely demented patients."

We examined the prevalence of daytime hypertension in a modern sample of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and assessed the relative risk factors contributing to the development of hypertension in this disorder. Daytime hypertension was present in 92 (45 percent) of 206 male and female patients with OSA. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that only age and body mass index (BMI) were predictors of hypertension in this population. A subsample of 152 male patients with OSA was then compared to 904 men identified from a geographically and ethnically similar general population. When one controlled for age and BMI, the prevalence of hypertension in the two groups was the same except for those aged 25 to 44 years who were markedly obese (BMI greater than 31 kg/m2). In this group, 47 percent of the patients with OSA were hypertensive vs 26 percent of control subjects (p less than 0.05). Our data suggest that the high prevalence of hypertension in OSA is primarily related to age and the excess obesity seen in these patients. In morbidly obese young patients with OSA, factors directly related to OSA may also be contributing to the development of hypertension. With increasing age, other competitive risks may obscure any independent effect that OSA may exert."

    "abstract": "The pathophysiology of anoxic injury in central nervous system white matter. White matter of the mammalian brain is susceptible to anoxic injury, but little is known about the pathophysiology of this process. We studied the mechanisms of anoxic injury in white matter using the isolated rat optic nerve, a typical central nervous system white-matter tract. Optic nerve function, measured as the area under the compound action potential, rapidly failed when exposed to anoxia. Postanoxic recovery was variable, depending on duration of the anoxic insult; after a standard 60-minute period of anoxia, the compound action potential recovered to 28.5% of control. Irreversible anoxic injury was critically dependent on extracellular Ca2+; maintaining the tissue in zero [Ca2+] solution throughout the anoxic period resulted in 100% compound action potential recovery. Increasing perfusate [Ca2+] during anoxia from zero to 4 mM resulted in progressively less recovery. Anoxic damage to the optic nerve appears to depend on the gradual accumulation (over tens of minutes) of Ca2+ in a cytoplasmic compartment. The inorganic Ca2+ channel blockers Mn2+ (1 mM), Co2+ (1 mM), or La3+ (0.1 mM) had no effect on recovery of the compound action potential after anoxia; only Mg2+ (10 mM) significantly improved recovery. Treatment with the dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers nifedipine (1-10 microM) or nimodipine (1-40 microM) also had no effect on recovery from anoxia. Thus, Ca2+ influx during anoxia does not occur via conventional Ca2+ channels. Preliminary evidence suggests that this Ca2+ influx may occur via other cation channels that are imperfectly selective for Ca2+ or via the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger."

When large portions of the internal orbit are destroyed (two to four walls), standard bone-grafting techniques for immediate and late orbital reconstruction may not yield predictable eye position. Critical bone support is most often deficient inferomedially. CT analysis of orbital volume in cases where eye position was unsatisfactory reveals that displacement of bone grafts is one mechanism of the unsatisfactory result. Other mechanisms include undercorrection and bone-graft resorption. In order to minimize postoperative bone-graft displacement, titanium implants were used to span large defects in the internal orbit to provide a platform for bone-graft support. Twenty-six implants were placed in immediate and 12 were placed in late orbital reconstructions. More reliable bone-graft position resulted. Two late infections have occurred resulting in implant removal in a 3-year period."

The nocturnal secretion of plasma melatonin was determined under dim to dark conditions in eight patients with prospectively confirmed premenstrual syndrome and in eight age- and menstrual cycle phase-matched normal control subjects. Plasma samples for melatonin were collected every 30 minutes from 6 PM to 9 AM during the early follicular, late follicular, midluteal and late luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Compared with normal controls, patients with premenstrual syndrome had an earlier (phase-advanced) offset of melatonin secretion, which contributed to a shorter secretion duration and a decreased area under the curve. No statistically significant differences were found between women with premenstrual syndrome and normal controls for melatonin onset or peak concentration, or for estradiol or progesterone levels. The data demonstrate that women with premenstrual syndrome have chronobiological abnormalities of melatonin secretion. The fact that these patients respond to treatments that affect circadian physiology, such as sleep deprivation and phototherapy, suggests that circadian abnormalities may contribute to the pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome."

Facioscapulohumeral disease (FSHD), an inherited neuromuscular disorder, is characterized by progressive wasting of specific muscle groups, particularly the proximal musculature of the upper limbs; the primary defect in this disorder is unknown. We studied a patient with FSHD to determine whether the mitochondrial respiratory chain was functionally abnormal. Muscle biopsy revealed fiber atrophy with patchy staining for oxidative enzymes. Electron microscopy of a liver section showed many enlarged mitochondria with paracrystalline inclusions. Decreased oxidation of the respiratory substrates-alanine and succinate-in skin fibroblasts suggested a deficiency of complex III of the electron-transport chain; cytochrome c oxidase activity (complex IV) was in the normal range. Biochemical analysis of liver supported the fibroblast data, since succinate oxidase activity (electron-transport activity through complexes II-IV) was reduced, whereas complex IV activity was normal. Furthermore, analysis of the cytochrome spectrum in liver revealed typical peaks for cytochromes cc1 and aa3, whereas cytochrome b (a component of complex III) was undetectable. Southern blot analysis of fibroblast mtDNA revealed no major deletions or rearrangements. Our study provides the first documentation of a specific enzyme-complex deficiency associated with FSHD."

Spontaneous osteonecrosis about the knee typically is a disease of the elderly characterized by an acute onset of pain. The exact cause of this condition has long been debated, although a causative relationship between meniscal tears and spontaneous osteonecrosis about the knee has been postulated. Seven patients with knee pain, meniscal tears, and chondromalacia without initial evidence of osteonecrosis at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging underwent arthroscopic surgery with meniscal recontouring or repair and cartilage shaving. These patients returned within 2-14 months with recurrent pain in the treated knee. MR imaging then demonstrated abnormalities consistent with osteonecrosis. Osteonecrosis of the femoral condyle or tibial plateau may be a late sequela of meniscal injury in association with chondromalacia and arthroscopic surgery. This diagnosis should be suspected in patients with recurrent knee pain after arthroscopic repair of meniscal tears. The precise relationship of this pattern of osteonecrosis to that previously described as spontaneous requires further investigation."

To study whether the proportion of excess cardiovascular events attributable to various levels of systolic blood pressure varies with age, we calculated the population-attributable risk of all-cause mortality, fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (stroke, coronary heart disease, angina, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease), and stroke incidence due to systolic blood pressure in men and women 45 years of age or older in the United States during 1980. Our estimates are based on US census counts, blood pressure prevalence distributions from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the annual risk of cardiovascular complications during 18 years of follow-up in the Framingham cohort. We then determined the impact of age on the relative efficacy of mass treatment and case-finding strategies in preventing systolic blood pressure-related events. At 45-54 years of age, only 30-40% of systolic blood pressure-related excess events occur in hypertensive individuals (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg). With increasing age, however, the percentage of systolic blood pressure-related events that occur in hypertensive individuals rose substantially; in the older age group (greater than or equal to 75 years), 65-70% of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease events occur in hypertensive persons. The pattern is similar for men and women. The potential impact of a mass treatment strategy designed to shift the distribution of blood pressure downward by a small amount is greater in younger than in older groups, whereas an opposite trend is seen for a high-risk, hypertensive case-finding and treatment approach."

This study assesses the value of the auditory P300 event-related potential--a slow component of the auditory evoked response--as a tool in this field. Twenty-one nonencephalopathic and 12 encephalopathic (grade 1/2) cirrhotic patients and 26 controls were assessed clinically and psychometrically. Electroencephalogram spectral analysis and visual evoked response recordings were also conducted. An auditory P300 wave was elicited using the standard two-tone discrimination paradigm. The latency and amplitude of this wave were measured. The latency of the P300 was found to be significantly increased in the encephalopathic patients compared with both nonencephalopathic cirrhotic and control groups (p less than 0.05). Amplitude of the wave was decreased in both nonencephalopathic and encephalopathic patients, but this was not statistically significant. This study suggests that the latency of the P300 is a good marker of grades 1 and 2 clinical hepatic encephalopathy. The delays in the P300 latency may indicate that encephalopathic patients have a deterioration of their stimulus evaluation abilities."

We have encountered three cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome related to withdrawal of levodopa therapy. These cases illustrate the variety of circumstances in which alteration of therapy with dopaminergic drugs can cause this syndrome and the relative unfamiliarity of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome-levodopa relationship among physicians who do not treat large numbers of patients with Parkinson's disease. An understanding of the role of brain dopamine in the pathogenesis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and an appreciation of the great variety of drugs whose manipulation can result in this potentially fatal syndrome will aid its proper and timely recognition, especially when the offending pharmacologic manipulation does not involve neuroleptic drugs."

DESIGN--Prospective longitudinal study. SUBJECTS--A total of 18,403 male civil servants aged 40-64 years at entry examination for the Whitehall study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Mortality from cerebrovascular disease (ICD8 430-438) after 18 years of follow up. RESULTS--In all, 262 men with sinus rhythm at entry died due to stroke during the 18 years of follow up. Compared with men with a forced expiratory volume in one second of greater than or equal to 3.5 litres those with a value of less than 3.0 litres were almost twice as likely to die of cerebrovascular disease (rate ratio adjusted for age and systolic blood pressure = 1.88, 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 2.69). This increased risk occurred within each tertile of systolic blood pressure. Nested case-control analyses were used to control precisely for confounding effects of age, height, and smoking (by matching) and employment grade and physiological risk factors (by modelling). The effect of forced expiratory volume in one second was independent of age, height, smoking habits, employment grade, blood pressure, weight, cholesterol concentration, glucose tolerance, electrocardiographic abnormalities, history of chest pain, and history of intermittent claudication. CONCLUSIONS--Measurements of ventilatory function may assist clinical decisions about whether to treat mild hypertension. Impaired ventilatory function and stroke may share common causes."

Follow-up computed tomographic scans were performed later than 1 month after subarachnoid hemorrhage to reveal permanent hypodense areas consistent with cerebral infarction. Occurrence of hypodense lesions on the follow-up computed tomographic scan was significantly associated with the presence of delayed ischemic deterioration (DID) (P less than 0.01). Patients with subcortical or cortical cerebral infarctions due to DID released more platelet thromboxane B2 than those with no evidence of a hypodense lesion on the computed tomographic scan (P less than 0.05). Hypodense areas caused by an intracerebral hematoma or small, deep-seated infarcts due to DID were not associated with significantly elevated release of thromboxane B2, but the lacunar type infarcts were associated with increased aggregation of platelets. The results suggest that augmented platelet function may be involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction due to DID."

We attempted to determine whether the degree of lateralization of independent bitemporal interictal spikes and sharp waves (ISSW) is correlated with good results after temporal lobectomy. Three observers independently counted ISSW in the scalp EEGs of 59 candidates for temporal lobectomy to determine the degree of lateralization of ISSW. Interobserver correlation in percentage of lateralization was excellent (r = 0.92). Thirty-one candidates were also evaluated with depth EEG (DEEG). Operative success was graded by the number of seizures reported in the second postoperative year. There was a significant progressive decrease in the number of good operative results as the degree of lateralization of ISSW lessened (p = 0.0142). Ninety-two percent of patients with greater than 90% lateralization had a good surgical outcome, whereas only 50% with less than 90% lateralization had a good outcome. Even when all DEEG-recorded seizures emerged from the side of the lobectomy, patients with greater than 90% lateralization appeared to have better outcomes than patients with less than 90% lateralization. We conclude that greater than 90% lateralization of temporal ISSW is associated with good surgical outcome, and DEEG may not be necessary in these patients. Less than 90% lateralization is associated with poor surgical outcome and the additional information provided by DEEG may be especially useful in such patients."

The procedure seems to be well tolerated in young patients, and we have not noted a postoperative deterioration in behavior, memory, or language function in our patients. One of our patients died in status epilepticus 3 months after surgery. Nevertheless, we have not encountered any serious morbidity in our other patients. Corpus callosotomy can be considered for children with intractable seizures, especially when generalized atonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic (whether primary or secondary) seizures are the major seizure type."

Fetal ventral mesencephalon and fetal adrenal tissue grafted to the caudate nucleus of four and three parkinsonian patients, respectively, have been shown to be an alternative treatment for the amelioration of the signs of the disease. The ventral mesencephalon patients had a significant amelioration of rigidity, bradykinesia, postural imbalance, gait disturbance, and facial expression. Three of these four patients have returned to work. The fatal adrenal group only showed amelioration of rigidity and bradykinesia. Though these patients are now able to perform their basic daily living activities, and one of them has renewed her household tasks, the other two have not yet been able to return to work. The differences observed between the ventral mesencephalon- and the fetal adrenal-transplanted patients may be related to the heterogeneity of their disease and/or the type of graft implanted. However encouraging our results may be, this experimental procedure obviously requires further studies, and should not be practiced outside of highly qualified clinical research centers."

This study examined effects of local reductions in mean and pulse pressures on cerebral arterioles in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). WKY and SHRSP underwent clipping of one carotid artery at 1 month of age. At 10-12 months of age, mechanics of pial arterioles were examined in vivo in anesthetized rats. Bilateral craniotomies were performed to expose pial arterioles in the sham and clipped cerebral hemispheres. Stress-strain relations were calculated from measurements of pial arteriolar pressure (servo null), diameter, and cross-sectional area of the arteriolar wall. Point counting stereology was used to quantitate individual components in the arteriolar wall. Before deactivation of smooth muscle with EDTA, mean (Pm) and pulse (Pp) pressures were significantly less (p less than 0.05) in clipped than in sham arterioles in WKY (Pm, 63 +/- 2 versus 73 +/- 2 mm Hg; Pp, 23 +/- 3 versus 30 +/- 3 mm Hg) and SHRSP (Pm, 94 +/- 4 versus 110 +/- 4 mm Hg; Pp, 27 +/- 2 versus 38 +/- 3 mm Hg). Cross-sectional area of the arteriolar wall was less (p less than 0.05) in clipped than in sham arterioles in both groups of rats (1,403 +/- 125 versus 1,683 +/- 125 microns2 in WKY; 1,436 +/- 72 versus 1,926 +/- 134 microns2 in SHRSP). There was a correlation between cross-sectional area of the vessel wall and pulse pressure (r2 = 0.66), but not mean pressure (r2 = 0.09). During maximal dilatation with EDTA, the stress-strain curve was shifted to the left in clipped arterioles of SHRSP, but not of WKY, which indicates that carotid clipping in SHRSP reduces passive distensibility of cerebral arterioles. The proportion of distensible components in the vessel wall (smooth muscle, elastin, and endothelium) was reduced in clipped arterioles in SHRSP, but not in WKY. These findings suggest that 1) vascular hypertrophy of cerebral arterioles is related more closely to pulse pressure than to mean pressure, and 2) reduction of pial arteriolar pressure completely prevents cerebral vascular hypertrophy and attenuates increases in passive distensibility of cerebral arterioles in SHRSP."

The lack of effective therapy for many of the chronic neuromuscular diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), spinocerebellar degenerations and idiopathic polyneuropathy has led to a search for substances that may stimulate peripheral nerve regeneration. Two such agents that have been proposed are gangliosides (mixed purified bovine brain gangliosides, Cronassial) and thyrotropin releasing factor (TRH). Studies on both of these agents were initially reported with enthusiasm to be successful, but later double-blind controlled studies have failed to confirm these findings. This review provides critical analysis of the designs of studies of potentially effective agents in chronic neuromuscular diseases, and emphasizes the power of the placebo response, and the importance of designing placebos which are indistinguishable from the trial medication other than in the active effect."

The relationship between focal disturbances of glucose utilization demonstrated by positron emission tomography (PET) and electrophysiologic abnormalities defined by intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) was studied in eight children (aged 13 months to 12 years) who underwent cortical resection because of intractable seizures. None of the children had pure temporal lobe epilepsy. Computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were normal in four of the eight children. The scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) showed lateralized interictal epileptiform abnormalities in all eight and lateralized ictal onset in five of eight. In seven children, interictal PET showed focal hypometabolism; the eighth child had focal, ictal hypermetabolism. ECoG at the time of surgery showed epileptiform spiking, slowing, and/or suppression of normal background activity that in every case corresponded to the focus on PET scan. The ECoG findings support the notion that in children with epilepsy focal metabolic abnormalities on PET correspond to electrophysiologically abnormal areas of cortex, which are presumably also the epileptogenic regions. Such areas can appear normal on anatomic imaging studies (CT and MRI). When ictal scalp EEG data are ambiguous or contradictory, PET provides a less invasive means than chronic grid or depth electrode recording for evaluating whether a localized epileptogenic area exists."

The immunohistochemical studies demonstrated increased deposition of TGF-beta, type VI collagen, and fibronectin epitopes in the extracellular matrix of the fascia in comparison to the adjacent dermis in the same specimens. Increased levels of type VI collagen mRNA, as evidenced by positive in situ hybridization signals with an alpha 2(VI) collagen cDNA, were also found in the fascia in comparison with the dermis. In situ hybridizations of affected fascia with a human sequence-specific TGF-beta 1 cDNA demonstrated numerous fibroblasts displaying positive hybridization signals indicative of high levels of transcripts for this cytokine. In contrast, no hybridization signal for TGF-beta 1 was detected in fibroblasts in the adjacent dermis.

    "abstract": "Effect of cardiac output reduction on rate of desaturation in obstructive apnea. The nadir of SaO2 during an obstructive apnea is dependent upon the apnea's duration and the rate of fall of saturation (dSaO2/dt). We postulated that a low Q, such as in patients with congestive heart failure with sleep apnea, or a reduction in Q, as seen in some humans during obstructive sleep apnea, might steepen dSaO2/dt. The mechanism postulated was lowering of SvO2 with increased pulmonary capillary blood oxygen uptake and faster depletion of alveolar oxygen. This study examines dSaO2/dt following the onset of apnea in eight spontaneously breathing adult baboons. Nonrepetitive obstructive apneas (30, 45, and 60 seconds) were created by clamping an indwelling cuffed endotracheal tube at the end of expiration. Following baseline measurements, the animals were given a bolus of a rapid-acting beta-adrenergic blocker followed by continuous infusion to reduce cardiac output and to limit the cardiovascular response to obstructive asphyxia. Fiberoptic catheters were used for continuous monitoring of SaO2, SvO2, and cardiac output. Esophageal pressure and relative thoracic gas volume (Respitrace) were monitored to insure equivalence of lung volume at the onset of apnea. Beta-adrenergic blockade reduced resting Q by a mean of 25 percent. The blocked vs unblocked dSaO2/dt was 0.73 vs 0.72 percent/s, 0.76 vs 0.73 percent/s, and 0.70 vs 0.71 percent/s for 30-second, 45-second, and 60-second apneas, respectively. Thus, mean dSaO2/dt for all durations of apneas was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade. We concluded that dSaO2/dt is not influenced by limited Q preceding or induced by obstructive asphyxia."

The numbers decreased in parallel with clinical improvement after treatment. Anti-MBP IgG antibody-secreting cells were also observed in the CSF from patients with a variety of other inflammatory diseases of the nervous system, and their role in the development of tissue damage remains unsettled.

The effect of various Ca++ antagonists and local anesthetics on neuronal cell degeneration induced by veratridine was studied in primary rat brain neuronal cultures. Cell death was quantified by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) released in the culture medium. The neuronal cell degeneration was Ca+(+)-dependent because, in the absence of extracellular Ca++, 16 hr of exposure to 30 microM veratridine failed to produce release of LDH. Ca++ antagonists, nonselective for slow Ca++ channels (flunarizine, cinnarizine, lidoflazine, prenylamine and bepridil) inhibited veratridine-induced release of LDH with IC50 values between 0.11 and 0.47 microM. Ca++ antagonists selective for slow Ca++ channels were less potent and inhibited veratridine-induced release of LDH at concentrations in the following order of potency: nicardipine greater than gallopamil and verapamil greater than niludipine greater than nitrendipine greater than nifedipine greater than nimodipine greater than diltiazem. Tested local anesthetics were incomplete inhibitors of veratridine-induced release of LDH. A good correlation was found between the potency of the drugs to inhibit released LDH induced by 30 microM veratridine in neuronal cultures and their binding affinity for the batrachotoxin binding site of Na+ channels in rat cortex synaptosomal preparation. It is concluded that protection against veratridine-induced neurotoxicity can be mediated by blocking a veratridine-sensitive Na+ channel. It is a property of certain nonselective Ca++ antagonists. There is apparently no direct relationship with Ca++ antagonistic activity. The effect is unrelated to local anesthetic activity."

Four subjects with thermolabile methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) were discovered among 16 \"obligate\" heterozygotes for severe MTHFR deficiency and their family members. All four subjects had less than 25% of normal mean MTHFR specific activity in lymphocyte extracts. Three of them with normal serum folate and cyanocobalamin had intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia, and one with high serum folate and cyanocobalamin had no excessive accumulation of serum homocysteine. The biochemical features in these four subjects are distinguishable from subjects homozygous for the thermolabile MTHFR, whose specific activity is approximately 50% of the normal mean, and from heterozygotes for severe MTHFR deficiency, in whom the enzyme is thermostable and has a specific activity of about 50% of the normal mean. We propose that these four subjects are genetic compounds of the allele for the severe mutation and the allele for thermolabile mutation of the MTHFR gene. It is postulated that subjects with this genetic compound are more susceptible to the development of intermediate hyperhomocysteinemia despite normal folate and B12 levels. Nonetheless, hyperhomocysteinemia due to this compound heterozygosity is correctable by oral folic acid therapy."

The injection of carbachol into the pontine tegmentum of decerebrate cats evokes a postural motor atonia that has many of the characteristics of the atonia of natural rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep (Morales et al. J. Neurophysiol. 57: 1118-1129, 1987). We have used the carbachol-injected decerebrate cat to study the changes in respiratory neuronal activity that accompany the atonia. The activities of representative respiratory motor nerves--phrenic, intercostal, and hypoglossal--and that of a motor branch of C4 were recorded in decerebrate, vagotomized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated cats. After the microinjection of carbachol, there was a profound suppression of activity in all the nerves and a decrease in respiratory rate. This was a consistent stereotyped response in which the magnitude of the suppression of respiratory-related activity was phrenic (to approximately 65% of control) less than inspiratory intercostal (approximately 50%) less than hypoglossal (approximately 10%) less than expiratory intercostal (approximately 5%). The decrease in respiratory rate (to approximately 70% of control) was caused by a prolongation of both inspiratory and expiratory durations. Complete reversal of the carbachol effect was elicited by the microinjection of atropine into the same site as the carbachol injection. This allowed us to produce a second episode of atonia by the injection of carbachol into the contralateral pons. Thus we have demonstrated the existence of neural pathways originating in the cholinoceptive cells of the pons that have the potential to powerfully and differentially depress various respiratory motoneuronal pools and to reduce the respiratory rate. These pathways are likely to be activated along with the atonia of REM sleep."

Thirty minutes later, a continuous intravenous infusion of lidocaine (2.3 mg/kg per minute) was begun in both experiments. Biparietal electroencephalographic activity was monitored continuously. At the onset of electroencephalographic seizure activity, arterial plasma magnesium and lidocaine concentrations were measured. In groups I and III (experiment 1), brain parenchymal magnesium was also assayed. There were no differences in plasma lidocaine concentrations (in experiments 1 or 2) between saline solution and hypermagnesemic groups at onset of seizures. Brain magnesium level was unaltered by magnesium sulfate infusion. We conclude that acute administration of magnesium sulfate alters neither brain magnesium level nor the plasma lidocaine concentration associated with onset of electroencephalographic seizures."

    "abstract": "Stereotactic radiosurgery of meningiomas. Stereotactic radiosurgery has an expanding role in the management of selected intracranial tumors. In an initial 30-month experience using the 201-source cobalt-60 gamma knife at the University of Pittsburgh, 50 patients with meningiomas were treated. The most frequent site of origin was the skull base. Previously, 36 patients (72%) had undergone at least one craniotomy and four patients (8%) had received fractionated external beam radiation therapy. Stereotactic radiosurgery was the primary treatment modality in 16 patients (32%) with symptomatic tumors demonstrated by neuroimaging. Computer imaging-generated isodose plans (with one to five irradiation isocenters) for single-treatment irradiation gave optimal (greater than or equal to 50% isodose line) coverage in 44 patients (88%). The proximity of cranial nerves or vascular, pituitary, and brain-stem structures to the often convoluted tumor mass was crucial to dose selection. Serial imaging studies were evaluated in all 50 patients. Twenty-four patients were examined between 12 and 36 months after treatment; 13 (54%) showed a reduction in tumor volume while nine (38%) showed no change. Of 26 patients evaluated between 6 and 12 months after treatment, four showed a decrease in tumor size while 22 showed no change. Two patients (both with large tumors that received suboptimal irradiation) had delayed tumor growth outside the radiosurgical treatment volume. The actuarial 2-year tumor growth control rate was 96%. Between 3 and 12 months after radiosurgery, three patients developed delayed neurological deficits that gradually improved, compatible with delayed radiation injury. Although extended follow-up monitoring over many years will be necessary to fully evaluate treatment, to date stereotactic radiosurgery has proved to be a relatively safe and effective therapy for selected patients with symptomatic meningiomas, including those who failed surgical resection. Radiosurgery was an effective primary treatment alternative for those patients whose advanced age, medical condition, or high-risk tumor location mitigated against surgical resection."

    "abstract": "A randomized comparison of manipulation of the fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures may be performed under local or general anaesthesia: the latter is by far the most popular method in Britain, though why is hard to define. We have attempted to compare the 2 approaches by means of a randomized, prospective trial. Fifty consecutive, adult patients with radiologically proved fractures of the nasal bones were randomized to a local or general anaesthesia group and underwent manipulation with Asch's and Walsham's forceps between 7 and 15 days post-injury. Analysis of results at 4 h and 8 weeks post-operatively showed no significant benefit conferred by fracture reduction under general anaesthesia as opposed to local anaesthesia with respect to post-operative airway patency or cosmesis. It is suggested that significant benefits can be obtained in terms of patient convenience and cost effectiveness if nasal fractures are reduced under local anaesthesia as an outpatient procedure."

    "abstract": "Molecular genetic basis of maple syrup urine disease in a family with two defective alleles for branched chain acyltransferase and localization of the gene to human chromosome 1. Maple syrup urine disease in humans results from inherited defects in branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial multienzyme complex. A variety of genetic changes may produce this phenotype by affecting the function of any of the three complex-specific subunits. The varied clinical expression observed in patients may be partially explained by the defects in the involved subunit. Here we report localization of the gene for the branched chain acyltransferase component of the complex to human chromosome 1 and describe a proband who is a compound heterozygote at this locus. One allele, inherited from the father, produces transcripts with 124 nucleotides deleted from the coding region. The deletion is not found in the branched chain acyltransferase gene, implying that the deleted transcripts arise by an error in transcript processing. Cells from the patient's mother contain 50% of the normal amount of mRNA for the subunit, and the proband has inherited this nonexpressing allele from her. As a result, the proband produces no acyltransferase protein and therefore has greatly impaired complex activity. A phenotypically normal sibling is shown to be genetically similar to the mother having inherited the mother's nonexpressing allele and the father's normal allele."

The concentration of keratan sulfate (KS) epitope was measured in the serum of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared with that in the serum of patients with primary fibromyalgia syndrome (PFS) and of controls who had no joint disease. By Student's tau-test, the mean serum KS concentrations in OA and RA patients measured with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) 5-D-4 and 2-D-3 were significantly increased over those in the PFS and normal groups; similar findings were observed using a nonparametric test, except that levels in RA patients showed no difference from those in PFS patients and normal subjects. There was no significant correlation between joint scores or disease duration and KS levels in OA or RA patients. Gel filtration of sera revealed mainly large, polydisperse KS-bearing fragments which eluted in a broad profile. KS purified from sera by immunoaffinity chromatography consisted mainly of high-density proteoglycans. Electrophoresis of pooled high-density KS fractions in polyacrylamide-agarose gels followed by Western blotting with MAb 5-D-4 showed diffuse bands with relative mobilities corresponding to large proteoglycans. These findings are consistent with attachment of KS to protein core fragments of various sizes; KS in patient sera is comparable in size with that in normal sera. Elevations of serum KS levels occur in the presence of cartilage degradation, but do not quantitatively define the extent or duration of articular involvement."

We studied neurologic morbidity and its evolution during hyperglycemia induced immediately after permanent unilateral common carotid artery ligation in Mongolian gerbils. A total of 60 animals were divided into five groups: one experiencing severe hyperglycemia for 1 hour after the onset of ischemia (brief hyperglycemia group, n = 13), a normoglycemic control group for the brief hyperglycemia group (n = 12), a group with severe hyperglycemia for 4 hours after the onset of ischemia (prolonged hyperglycemia group, n = 11), a normoglycemic control group for the prolonged hyperglycemia group (n = 13), and a hyperosmolar normoglycemic control group for the prolonged hyperglycemia group (n = 11). Neurologic morbidity and mortality were higher in the two hyperglycemic groups than in the three normoglycemic control groups. The neurologic deficit progressed according to the duration of severe hyperglycemia. In the three normoglycemic control groups neurologic status stabilized 120 minutes after the onset of ischemia, in the brief hyperglycemia group stabilization occurred at 210 minutes, and in the prolonged hyperglycemia group neurologic deficit progressed for approximately 360 minutes, coinciding with the death of all but one gerbil, in which the neurologic deficit remained stable until death 23 hours after ischemia. We suggest that hyperglycemia is another cause of progressing cerebral infarction."

Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of rat corticotropin-releasing factor (rCRF) at doses of 5-20 micrograms in rats induces epileptogenic activity characterized by pacemaker-like spikes localized in the hippocampal leads. Such an effect was still present in rats neonatally treated with saline but was absent in those neonatally treated with monosodium glutamate (MSG), a treatment that caused marked changes in the concentration of several brain neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in hypothalamic nuclei where CRF is highly concentrated and is believed to induce endocrinologic and behavioral effects. The present results suggest the rCRF-induced spiking activity is mediated by activation of neuronal pathways sensitive to MSG neurotoxic effect."

The diagnostic utility of lower extremity radiographs was evaluated using 84 outpatients 1 to 5 years of age with gait disturbance whose lower extremities appeared physically normal. Chief complaints included limp (65 children [77%]), refusal to walk or stand (37 children [44%]), and frequent falling (6 children [7%]). A total of 43 children (51%) had more than one complaint. The mean age of patients was 26 months and the median duration of symptoms was 1 day. Trauma was reported in 43 (51%) cases and fever in 14 (17%). Results of radiographical studies appeared normal in 81 children (96%), demonstrated soft tissue swelling in 2 children, and revealed a bony island in 1 child. In 1 patient admitted to the hospital for failure to thrive and irritability, and whose radiographic results appeared normal, findings consistent with osteomyelitis later developed. Of the remaining children, 68 (81%) were available for follow-up observation 4 to 28 months after the initial visit and all reported spontaneous resolution of the initial complaint. It was concluded that in a well-appearing child with an otherwise normal physical examination results, an acute gait disturbance is likely to be a self-limiting condition and radiographs are unlikely to contribute to the diagnosis."

    "abstract": "Spatial dispersion of magnetic stimulation in peripheral nerves. To assess the longitudinal dispersion of the stimulus induced by the magnetic coil, collision experiments were performed in seven normal ulnar nerves. A supramaximal electrical stimulus S1 was delivered at the wrist, and followed by a supramaximal stimulus S2 in the upper arm, which was either electrical (electrical collision studies), or magnetic (magnetic collision studies). The interstimulus interval was varied by 0.2 msec increments from the time of complete cancellation of the S2 evoked motor response onwards, to include the entire span of recovery of that compound motor action potential. Collision curves were obtained for both magnetic and electrical stimuli by plotting the amplitude of the motor response elicited by S2 as a function of the interstimulus interval. In all seven normal ulnar nerves, comparison of the collision curves showed that the S2 evoked motor response is restored significantly more slowly when magnetic stimulation is used. This finding is best explained by longitudinal dispersion of the stimulus induced by the magnetic coil relative to conventional electrical stimulation, the large fibers being stimulated further away from the coil than the small ones. This interpretation is confirmed by the findings obtained with the same method in two cases of ulnar neuropathy, and by comparison of different intensities of magnetic stimulation."

Ten patients subsequently underwent a second operation to complete the callosal sectioning which resulted in additional seizure improvement in only five of them. Five complications resulted from 90 operations: two epidural hematomas, one delayed subdural hematoma, one bone-flap infection, and one postcallosotomy disconnection syndrome; two patients died.

We critically appraised the medical literature to evaluate whether there is a point beyond which blood pressure reduction in hypertensive subjects is no longer beneficial and possibly even deleterious. Thirteen studies that stratified cardiovascular outcomes by level of achieved blood pressure in treated hypertensive subjects who had been followed up for at least 1 year were critiqued by four independent reviewers. Data addressing population, protocol, and methodological characteristics were evaluated. Studies did not show a consistent J-shaped relationship between treated blood pressure and stroke, but they did demonstrate a consistent J-shaped relationship for cardiac events and diastolic blood pressure. The beneficial therapeutic threshold point was 85 mm Hg. We conclude that low treated diastolic blood pressure levels, ie, below 85 mm Hg, are associated with increased risk of cardiac events."

Monoclonal antibody immunocytochemistry was used to examine spinal cord and muscle in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for changes that would indicate ongoing or potential immune activity. Increased expression of class I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens was seen in the affected areas of spinal cord. New MHC expression was concentrated in phagocytes, particularly in degenerating white matter in which they were dispersed in the tissue and also packed around blood vessels. MHC antigen was not revealed in motor neurons or skeletal muscle fibers. An anti-pan-T-cell monoclonal revealed small numbers of T cells in degenerating white matter. Similar changes have been seen in other neurodegenerative disorders. They suggest a potential for (secondary) cell-mediated activity in the affected areas rather than an ongoing MHC-restricted T-cell response. Vessel-associated phagocytes may be a source of antigen to peripheral lymphoid tissue, stimulating production of the autoantibodies that have been described."

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that quantitation of either C-reactive protein (CRP) or the total peripheral WBC count can improve clinical detection of underlying bacterial meningitis among young febrile children. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of selected symptoms of central nervous system infection, signs of meningeal irritation and/or elevated intracranial pressure, levels of CRP in serum, and total peripheral WBC counts among unselected pediatric patients undergoing lumbar punctures for evaluation of acute febrile illnesses. SETTING: Emergency department and acute care \"walk-in\" clinic of an urban, university-affiliated general hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 160 previously well, acutely febrile infants and children (median age, 6 months). RESULTS: The prevalence of bacterial meningitis was 6%. Sensitivity of symptoms was 1.00 and specificity was 0.17. Sensitivity of signs was 0.70 and specificity was 0.81. Of the acute phase reactants, sensitivity of a CRP level of more than 1.0 mg/dL was 0.80, while that of a total peripheral WBC count of more than 15,000/mm3 was 0.40. The presence of signs and/or a CRP level of more than 1.0 mg/dL correctly identified all children with bacterial meningitis (sensitivity, 1.00). The absence of signs and a CRP level of 1.0 mg/dL or less correctly identified 71 of 150 children without bacterial meningitis (specificity, 0.47). Of 125 children without meningeal signs, the combination of symptoms and a CRP level of more than 1.0 mg/dL correctly identified all three children with bacterial meningitis (sensitivity, 1.00). The absence of these symptoms and/or a CRP level of 1.0 mg/dL or less correctly identified 80 of 122 children without bacterial meningitis (specificity, 0.66). CONCLUSION: Quantitation of CRP but not the total peripheral WBC count can increase the sensitivity of physical examination findings and the specificity of symptoms for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. Measurement of CRP in serum is useful as an adjunct to history and physical examination for the detection of acute bacterial meningitis in the acutely febrile child."

There is evidence that post-injury hypersensitivity is partly due to changes in the central nervous system. Sheep with foot rot were used to investigate the effect of chronic pain on some receptors thought to be involved in spinal nociceptive processing systems (alpha 2 adrenoceptor and mu and delta opioid receptors). Saturation binding studies showed a variable distribution of [3H] clonidine (alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist) in the spinal cord of normal sheep. The number of receptors (Bmax) present in areas thought to be involved in nociceptive processing, laminae I and II and lamina X, increased to 131% and 169% of control sheep values respectively in animals exposed to chronic pain. The affinity of the receptors (KD), however, remained unchanged at approximately 2 nM. There was less [3H]DAGO (mu opioid agonist) and [3H]DPDPE (delta opioid agonist) binding in the sheep spinal cord. Both opioid receptor types being mainly located in the superficial dorsal horn. The [3H]DPDPE binding was unchanged in the sheep with foot rot, whilst the number (Bmax), but not the affinity, of the [3H]DAGO binding sites increased in laminae I and II in lame animals to 130% of the control sheep values. Hence, in animals in chronic pain, the number of alpha 2 adrenoceptors and mu opioid receptors increased mainly in areas of the sheep spinal cord associated with nociception."

    "abstract": "Use of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms to predict future vulnerability to side effects. OBJECTIVE: Susceptibility to neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal syndromes varies widely, even within age and sex subgroups. Individual vulnerability to extrapyramidal syndromes has been assumed to explain this, but the utility of past history for predicting future occurrence of extrapyramidal syndromes has not been studied extensively. This investigation was undertaken to determine whether patients' previous histories of extrapyramidal syndromes predict future episodes of extrapyramidal syndromes and to compare the importance of this predictive factor with patient age, sex, neuroleptic dose, and anticholinergic dose as predictors of extrapyramidal syndromes. METHODS: The charts of 62 schizophrenic patients with multiple neuroleptic treatment episodes were reviewed. Extrapyramidal syndromes, neuroleptic drug doses, and anticholinergic drug doses during the first 21 days of each treatment episode were recorded. RESULTS: Previous extrapyramidal syndromes correctly predicted extrapyramidal syndromes in subsequent treatments for 84% of the patients. Variations in neuroleptic potency, neuroleptic dose, and anticholinergic dose partially explained incorrect predictions. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that patients with a history of extrapyramidal syndromes are at greater risk for future extrapyramidal syndromes. If confirmed, these results strongly support individual susceptibility as a major predictor of extrapyramidal syndromes and indicate that prophylaxis of extrapyramidal syndromes should be considered for patients who have previously suffered extrapyramidal syndromes from similarly prescribed neuroleptic therapy."

A new method for detection of delirium OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a new standardized confusion assessment method (CAM) that enables nonpsychiatric clinicians to detect delirium quickly in high-risk settings. DESIGN: Prospective validation study. SETTING: Conducted in general medicine wards and in an outpatient geriatric assessment center at Yale University (site 1) and in general medicine wards at the University of Chicago (site 2). PATIENTS: The study included 56 subjects, ranging in age from 65 to 98 years. At site 1, 10 patients with and 20 without delirium participated; at site 2, 16 patients with and 10 without delirium participated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An expert panel developed the CAM through a consensus building process. The CAM instrument, which can be completed in less than 5 minutes, consists of nine operationalized criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III-R). An a priori hypothesis was established for the diagnostic value of four criteria: acute onset and fluctuating course, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. The CAM algorithm for diagnosis of delirium required the presence of both the first and the second criteria and of either the third or the fourth criterion. At both sites, the diagnoses made by the CAM were concurrently validated against the diagnoses made by psychiatrists. At sites 1 and 2 values for sensitivity were 100% and 94%, respectively; values for specificity were 95% and 90%; values for positive predictive accuracy were 91% and 94%; and values for negative predictive accuracy were 100% and 90%. The CAM algorithm had the highest predictive accuracy for all possible combinations of the nine features of delirium. The CAM was shown to have convergent agreement with four other mental status tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination. The interobserver reliability of the CAM was high (kappa = 0.81 - 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: The CAM is sensitive, specific, reliable, and easy to use for identification of delirium."

    "abstract": "Extracranial repair of cerebrospinal fluid fistulas: technique and results in 37 patients. Although neurosurgeons have traditionally preferred intracranial repair for the management of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas, this approach is associated with the complications of a craniotomy, anosmia, and a high incidence of recurrent fistulas. Extracranial repair, on the other hand, produces no central nervous system morbidity, preserves olfaction, and is associated with a low incidence of recurrence. Although there have been several reports of extracranial repair of CSF fistulas by otorhinolaryngologists, this approach has received scant mention in the neurosurgical literature. We report here our experience with 37 patients with CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea who underwent extracranial repair. The etiology of the fistula was postoperative in 22, traumatic in 6, and spontaneous in 9. The fistulas were repaired using one of four techniques: external ethmoid-sphenoid in 18 patients, transmastoid in 9, transseptosphenoid in 7, and osteoplastic frontal sinusotomy in 3. In 32 of the 37 patients (86%) the fistulas were successfully repaired with the initial procedure. Of the 5 patients requiring a second operation, the fistula was successfully closed in 4 for an overall success rate of 97%. Complications were few and consisted of a transient facial paresis in a patient undergoing transmastoid repair and one death from meningitis. The authors conclude that because of low morbidity and mortality and a high success rate in closing fistulas, extracranial repair is the preferred technique for the operative management of CSF rhinorrhea and otorrhea."

Twenty-four couples were eliminated from further analysis because of a discrepancy between husband and wife in the answers concerning sexual behavior after stroke. A marked decline in sexual activity after stroke was found in both genders; other aspects of sexual behavior underwent fewer changes. The feeling of an overall change in sexual life was reported more frequently by male patients. Most patients' spouses reported the feeling of an overall psychological change in their partners and the feeling of an overall change in sexual life after the onset of the illness. No significant associations were found between clinical features and changes in sexual life. This study confirms that cerebrovascular accidents are generally followed by some important alterations in sexual life. Clinical factors do not seem to play a crucial role in determining these changes, which may be better explained in terms of maladjustment attributable to psychologic and interpersonal factors."

A new surgical technique has been designed and was used successfully in 18 patients with ideal results. The key point of the operation is to turn over a flap of rectus abdominis muscle to envelop the bladder. Contraction of the muscle flap and the abdominal muscles would enhance voiding ability. In the meantime, the bladder is displaced forward and the resultant change in the bladder-posterior urethral angle also favors voiding. Since the bladder is near the anterior abdominal wall manual compression during voiding is made easier. All of these advantages greatly facilitate voiding."

The group losing visual fields had a higher mean visual field threshold value and significantly less optic disk pallor and cupping at the start of the study than the stable visual field group. Thus, a significant rate of visual field loss occurred at an earlier stage of the disease and showed a correlation with intraocular pressure in this stage."

The primary end-point was independence after 6 months, defined as a score of 60 or more on an activities of daily living (ADL) scale, the Barthel index. Patients were entered into the trial if they were aged over 40, became hemiparetic in the previous 48 h, were conscious, were able to swallow, and had been living independently before the stroke.

This report of an 88-year-old woman with familial hemifacial spasm includes the first published postmortem description of hemifacial spasm with cross-compression of the seventh cranial nerve root exit zone by a redundant loop of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery and associated vascular plexus. Histological examination of the seventh and eighth cranial nerve complex suggested nerve degeneration because increased numbers of corpora amylacea were present just distal to the compression concavity. There was no evidence of demyelination or gliosis of the nerve. This case suggests that vascular compression of the nerve root exit zone is an important condition in the etiology of most of these cases. This is the third reported case of familial hemifacial spasm; to date, all such patients have had left facial involvement. The family pedigree in this case suggests a pattern of autosomal-dominant inheritance with partial penetrance. The genetic basis for familial hemifacial spasm may involve anatomical variants or anomalies of the posterior circulation, since both posterior inferior cerebellar arteries were congenitally absent in this case."

The etiological factors include tumors and arteriovenous malformations; however, investigations of such lesions have been limited to patients with signs and symptoms of spinal cord or nerve root pathological processes. This report describes the management of a 56-year-old woman with clinical findings typical of an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and negative findings on cerebral angiography, in whom magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement revealed an intradural extramedullary cervical schwannoma. For this reason, cervicothoracic magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement should be considered as an adjunctive scanning examination in all patients with a subarachnoid hemorrhage and negative findings on angiography."

    "abstract": "Spontaneous electromyographic potentials in chronic spinal cord injured patients: relation to spasticity and length of nerve. Nine patients with complete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) had their vastus medialis, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscles evaluated with an electromyographic (EMG) examination in the acute (four to eight weeks) and chronic (more than one year) phases. The hypothesis that spontaneous EMG activity changes with time was assessed. During the chronic phase evaluation, a conduction study was performed to rule out peripheral nerve damage, and the amount of reflex activity was assessed on a scale of 0 to 5 (0 = areflexia; 5 = greater than 5 beats of clonus) to estimate the amount of spasticity. Subjects demonstrated normal conduction through the sensory (sural nerve) and/or motor segments of the peroneal and tibial nerves. In the acute phase, each muscle had spontaneous activity with no significant variation between different muscles of the same patient. In the chronic phase, there was a positive correlation between the degree of spontaneous activity in a muscle and the length of its axon (p less than .01) and a negative correlation between the amount of spontaneous activity and the degree of reflex activity (p less than .01). Specifically, the lower motor neuron in the chronic phase of an SCI seems to behave much like an axonopathy where the degree of spontaneous EMG activity is dependent on the length of the axon, with the additional concept that spontaneous activity is inhibited by spasticity."

The symptomatology of a typical acute descending thoracic aorta dissection was imitated by profuse haemorrhage caused by a benign tumour composed almost exclusively of Wagner-Meissner like tactile corpuscles and fatty tissue. The tumour caused extensive destruction of the bodies of the fifth and sixth thoracic vertebrae at the level of the vertebro-costal articulation. Emergency cross clamping of the descending aorta and haemostasis of the bleeding from osteal defects by tamponade with bone polymethyl methacrylate appeared the only way to control the life threatening haemorrhage. It seems that an intrathoracic tactile neurofibroma with a similar case history has not been reported till now."

Management of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) should be based on the presence and progression of visual loss. To characterize the clinical course of IIH more completely, we monitored the clinical status, especially visual function, in 50 consecutive newly-diagnosed patients over a period of 2 to 39 months (average follow-up 12.4 months). The mean age at onset of symptoms was 31 (range 11-58) yrs; 46 (92%) were women and 47 (94%) were obese (mean weight 90 kg). Common symptoms were headache (92%), transient visual obscurations (72%) and intracranial noises (60%); 13 of the patients (26%) initially had complaints of sustained visual loss. There was visual loss as determined by Goldmann perimetry in 96% and by automated perimetry in 92%. Contrast sensitivity testing was abnormal in 50% and Snellen acuity in 22%. Two patients (4%) became blind in both eyes. The Goldmann visual field grade improved in 60% of patients but visual function deteriorated in 5 (10%). Deterioration of visual field grade was significantly associated only with weight gain during the year before diagnosis. Visual loss in patients with IIH is common and is often reversible. Patients should be evaluated by perimetry using an appropriate strategy and contrast sensitivity testing, along with careful examination of the optic discs."

Forty-four aphasic patients were examined with (F18)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in a resting state to determine whether consistent glucose metabolic abnormalities were present. Ninety-seven percent of subjects showed metabolic abnormalities in the angular gyrus, 89% in the supramarginal gyrus, and 87% in the lateral and transverse superior temporal gyrus. Pearson product moment correlations were calculated between regional metabolic measures and performance on the Western Aphasia Battery. No significant correlations were found between the Western Aphasia Battery scores and right hemisphere metabolic measures. Most left hemisphere regions correlated with more than one score from the Western Aphasia Battery. Temporal but not frontal regions had significant correlations to the comprehension score. The left temporoparietal region was consistently affected in these subjects, suggesting that common features in the aphasias were caused by left temporoparietal dysfunction, while behavioral differences resulted from (1) the extent of temporoparietal changes, and (2) dysfunction elsewhere in the brain, particularly the left frontal and subcortical areas."

    "abstract": "The effect of glucose administration on carbohydrate metabolism after head injury. The role of intravenous infusion of glucose in limiting ketogenesis and the effect of glucose on cerebral metabolism following severe head injury were studied in 21 comatose patients. The patients were randomly assigned to alimentation with or without glucose. Systemic protein wasting, arterial concentrations of energy substrates, and cerebral metabolism of these energy substrates were monitored for 5 days postinjury. Both groups were in negative nitrogen balance, and had wasting of systemic proteins despite substantial protein intake. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose concentrations were highest on Day 1, but remained higher than normal fasting levels on all days of study, even in the patients who received no exogenous glucose. Although there were no differences in blood or CSF glucose concentrations in the two groups of patients, the glucose group had higher plasma insulin levels, with a mean +/- standard deviation of 14.8 +/- 7.3 microU/ml compared to 10.3 +/- 4.2 microU/ml in the saline group. The blood concentrations of beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, pyruvate, glycerol, and the free fatty acids were higher in the saline group than in the glucose group. Cerebral oxygen consumption was similar in the two groups, while the cerebral metabolism of glucose and of the ketone bodies was dependent on whether glucose was administered. In the glucose group, glucose was the only energy substrate utilized by the brain. In the saline group, the ketone bodies beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate replaced glucose to the extent of 16% of the brain's total energy production. Cerebral lactate production and CSF lactate concentration were lower in the saline group. These studies suggest that administration of glucose during the early recovery period of severe head injury is a major cause of suppressed ketogenesis, and may increase production of lactic acid by the traumatized brain by limiting the availability of nonglycolytic energy substrates."

    "abstract": "Role of diabetologist in evaluating diabetic retinopathy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of diabetologists to screen diabetic patients for diabetic retinopathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Comparison of eye examination performed by diabetologists with direct ophthalmoscopy through an undilated pupil and by ophthalmologists through a dilated pupil with seven-field stereoscopic fundus photography (gold standard). The study consisted of 67 insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetic outpatients attending a diabetes clinic. RESULTS: On the basis of fundus photography, patients were classified as having no or insignificant (30%), minimal (31%), moderate (24%), or severe (15%) retinopathy. The diabetologists and ophthalmologists performed similarly in their ability to classify severity of diabetic retinopathy accurately. When no or insignificant retinopathy (isolated microaneurysms only) was detected by examination, clinically significant retinopathy detected by fundus photography was highly unlikely (less than 5%). On the other hand, if more than isolated microaneurysms were seen on examination, all examiners missed more severe lesions detected by fundus photography. Patients with corrected visual acuity worse than 20/30 had a high likelihood (100%) of moderate or severe retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Motivated well-trained diabetologists can screen for diabetic retinopathy. The absence of detectable lesions by direct ophthalmoscopy indicates that automatic referral to an ophthalmologist is not necessary. However, if any level of retinopathy is detected or corrected acuity is worse than 20/30, referral to an ophthalmologist is required. In this setting, fundus photography is advised because it is the most sensitive means of detecting clinically significant retinopathy. If other nonophthalmologists can be trained to achieve similar results, current recommendations for ophthalmologic referral that require annual ophthalmologic examinations for most diabetic patients may need to be reconsidered."

In order to evaluate the mechanisms of weakness in muscles of patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), intercostal muscle biopsies were obtained from 9 normal subjects and 6 MG patients, and the compound muscle action potential (AP) and tension responses to nerve and muscle stimulation, and contracture responses on exposure to caffeine, were monitored in vitro. In normal muscle, on stimulation of the nerve or muscle at 30 to 100 Hz, the AP responses showed decrement in amplitude, one-third of which was attributable to failure of neuromuscular transmission and two-thirds to failure of muscle membrane excitation. On stimulation at 1 to 5 Hz, the AP responses showed very little decrement, while the contractile responses showed significant fade in tension, due to failure of E-C coupling or contractility. In muscle from patients with generalized MG, stimulation of the nerve at all frequencies (1 to 100 Hz) caused much greater decrement in APs and fade in tension responses than in normal muscle, due mainly to failure of neuromuscular transmission. However, at 100 Hz, 40% of the decrement in APs was due to failure of muscle membrane excitation, and at 1 to 5 Hz, 40% of the fade in tension was due to failure of E-C coupling or contractility, as in normal muscle. On direct stimulation the contraction and half-relaxation times were slower and the tetanic tension was smaller than in normal muscle, especially in the MG patient with thymoma. Caffeine-induced contractures were smaller in MG muscle than in normal muscle. These results indicate that while the weakness of MG muscle is due mainly to failure of neuromuscular transmission, it is also partly due to reduced E-C coupling or contractility."

The replication status of the fragile X chromosomes was studied in short-term cultures of lymphocytes from six female heterozygous carriers. The fragile X was induced by adding 0.1 microM fluorodeoxyuridine during the last 24 h of culturing. The replication status of the X chromosomes was studied using a bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) antibody method. BrdUrd was added (1) at a final concentration of 0.2 micrograms/ml during the early S phase of chromosome replication (16-10 h before harvest), (2) at 0.2 microgram/ml during the late S phase (the last 6 h of culturing), (3) at 20 micrograms/ml during the early S phase, and (4) at 20 micrograms/ml during the late S phase. BrdUrd that was incorporated into replicating chromosomes was detected by using a nuclease and BrdUrd monoclonal antibody. The frequency of the fragile X was reduced by BrdUrd treatment. The degree of reduction was more severe in the 20 micrograms/ml than in the 0.2 microgram/ml series and was more severe with late S than with early S treatment. Of the early- and late-replicating fragile X chromosomes, those which were actively replicating during a BrdUrd treatment were more reduced than the others. Thus, the average rate of early and late S treatment with 0.2 microgram BrdUrd/ml was assumed to be the closest reflection of the situation in vivo. There was no correlation between the average rate of the early replicating, active fragile X and the intelligence of the heterozygous carriers studied."

A comparison was made of the effects of experimental intracerebral inoculation into marmosets of brain homogenates from a case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and from a member of the Wo. family with cerebral amyloid and spongiform encephalopathy--the Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome. All the inoculated marmosets developed spongiform encephalopathy (SE) after incubation times of 20-23 months in the CJD group and 25-32 months in the GSS group. Subsequent passage from 1 affected animal in each group resulted in SE developing after 17 months incubation. In every animal inoculated with CJD or GSS material and in the 2 passage experiments the most severely affected region of the brain was the thalamus which in all cases was almost totally occupied by vacuoles. Other grey matter masses were less severely and less consistently affected. Vacuolation was observed in the cerebellar granule cell layer as well as in the molecular layer and the brain stem was finely vacuolated in all cases. There were only minor and inconsistent differences between the disease transmitted from CJD compared with GSS and some differences between the original transmissions and the SE caused by passaged inocula. Severe astrocytic gliosis accompanied the spongiform changes but no amyloid was identified in any of the marmosets with experimentally transmitted disease. The pathogenesis of the spongiform change in the thalamus was studied in a series of marmosets by light and electron microscopy 3-22 months after the intracerebral inoculation of CJD or GSS homogenates and was compared with controls. Dilated irregularly-shaped cisternae and the large complex vacuoles typical of SE, present in abundance after 18 and 22 months incubation, were considered most probably to be derived from cisternae of neuronal smooth endoplasmic reticulum."

Thirty-one children aged 3 to 15 years were followed for 5 to 11 years after suffering severe closed head trauma which caused coma for 1 week or more (median duration of coma 3 weeks). One patient remained in a persistent vegetative state until his death 9 years later. The other 30 recovered consciousness and were discharged. All suffered diminution of their abilities, and 24 of them had major permanent disability. The most common motor disabilities were pure spastic hemiparesis (seven cases), basal ganglia syndromes (four cases), ataxia (three cases), and a combination of hemiparesis and ataxia (five cases). Of the 30 patients, 26 regained independent ambulation, seven were epileptic, and 14 were dysarthric in various degrees. Only 10 had the cognitive ability to profit from the normal educational system, and none had attempted postsecondary education. Social problems were common. The worst outcomes were associated with intracranial bleeding and/or brain contusion seen on computerized tomography (CT) scans at the acute stage; the best were associated with normal CT scans. The degree of residual disability in these children seems no less than that of adults with trauma of similar severity."

We report here the results and conclusions from studies designed to answer some of the immediate questions raised by this finding. (1) Maximal stimulation of vagal C fibers at frequencies greater than 4 Hz prevents or reduces chemically and electrically induced seizures in young male rats. (2) Antiepileptic potency is directly related to the fraction of vagal C fibers stimulated. (3) Vagal stimulation shortens but does not shut down a chemical seizure once it has begun. (4) In rats, optimal stimulus frequency is approximately 10-20 Hz; duration of stimulus, 0.5-1 ms; and stimulus strength, 0.2-0.5 mA/mm2 of nerve cross-section. These results, when taken together with similar results obtained from dogs, monkeys, and humans, strongly suggest that periodic stimulation of the vagus nerve using appropriate stimulation parameters is a powerful method for preventing seizures. The data from the literature suggest that the antiepileptic actions of vagal stimulation are largely mediated by widespread release of GABA and glycine in the brainstem and cerebral cortex. The probable pathway is via projections from the nucleus of the solitary tract to the reticular formation and thence by diffuse projections to the cortex and other areas. Intermittent vagal stimulation has the potentiality of reducing the number and/or the intensity of seizures in patients with intractable epilepsy. These results indicate that feasibility studies in humans should be continued and expanded."

The diagnostic yield of transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography for identifying a cardiac source of embolism was compared in 79 patients presenting with unexplained stroke or transient ischemic attack. There were 35 men and 44 women with a mean age of 59 years (range 17 to 84); 52% had clinical cardiac disease. Both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms were performed using Doppler color flow and contrast imaging. Transesophageal echocardiography identified a potential cardiac source of embolism in 57% of the overall study group compared with only 15% by transthoracic echocardiography (p less than 0.0005). Compared with transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography more frequently identified atrial septal aneurysm associated with a patent foramen ovale (9 versus 1 of 79 patients, p less than 0.005), left atrial thrombus or tumor (6 versus 0 of 79 patients, p less than 0.05) and left atrial spontaneous contrast (13 versus 0 of 79 patients, p less than 0.0005). All cases of left atrial thrombus or spontaneous contrast were identified in patients with clinically identified cardiac disease. In the 38 patients with no cardiac disease, transesophageal echocardiography identified isolated atrial septal aneurysm and atrial septal aneurysm with a patent foramen ovale more frequently than transthoracic echocardiography (8 versus 2 of 38 patients, p less than 0.05). The two techniques had a similar rate of identifying apical thrombus and mitral valve prolapse. Overall, transesophageal echocardiography identified abnormalities in 39% of patients with no cardiac disease versus 19% for transthoracic echocardiography (p less than 0.005). Thus, transesophageal echocardiography identifies potential cardiac sources of embolism in the majority of patients presenting with unexplained stroke."

In an attempt to locate any atherosclerotic lesion in the ascending aorta and to prevent embolization, intraoperative B-mode ultrasonography was performed in 100 patients with ischemic heart disease (31 women and 69 men). Ultrasonography was carried out with a 10-MHz probe placed directly on the ascending aorta. Ultrasonic imaging demonstrated an atherosclerotic lesion in the lower half of the aorta in 76 patients (76%), a lesion in the upper half of the aorta in 89 patients (89%), and a lesion at the orifice of the innominate artery in 99 patients (99%). Prospective palpation identified an atherosclerotic lesion in 12 (25%) of 48 patients. Thoracic computed tomography in 79 patients showed calcification in the lower half of the aorta in 6 patients (7.6%) and in the upper half of the aorta in 11 (13.9%). Palpation and thoracic computed tomography underestimated the frequency of atherosclerotic lesions. Intraoperative ultrasonography accurately identified atherosclerotic disease. This technique allows the surgeon to modify cannulation, aortic clamping, and operative technique to reduce the risk of perioperative stroke due to embolization of atherosclerotic debris from the ascending aorta."

We tested patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and control subjects on a task of visuopatial attention.

For all subjects, validly cued targets were responded to faster than those that were invalidly cued. The difference between reaction times for invalidly and validly cued targets, which is hypothesized to measure attentional movement, was significantly increased for the patients. The performance of the controls on certain neuropsychological tests was correlated with their attentional ability. These correlations were altered by progressive supranuclear palsy. Physostigmine treatment of the patients induced a speeding of responses to invalidly cued targets as a function of the duration of the disease. These studies show defects in cognition and attention in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and demonstrate that physostigmine reduces some of the abnormal visual attentional performance."

Quantitative assessment of the vibration threshold of the second and fifth fingertips at 125Hz was performed on 28 affected limbs of 17 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) together with a median and ulnar sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) study. Twenty-six limbs of 26 age-matched healthy subjects were used as controls. Both the vibration threshold elevation of the second finger and the delay of median SNCV were significant in CTS patients as compared with controls (p less than .001). Although the ulnar SNCVs of all affected limbs were within the normal range, ten affected limbs (36%) were found to have a concomitant vibration threshold elevation of the fifth finger, and eight of those limbs were found to be exposed to chronic occupational mechanical stimulation at the wrist. These findings appear to support the presence of subclinical traumatic damage to the ulnar nerve at the wrist. In summary, digital vibration measurement can elucidate subclinical ulnar neuropathy in CTS which cannot be detected by SNCV studies."

The hippocampal areas of 34 autopsy specimen brains from aged demented and nondemented subjects were examined using double staining of Bodian and beta protein. In 18 cases (75.5 +/- 7.4 years old), none of the extracellular neurofibrillary tangles (E-NFTs) were immunoreactive with beta protein. In 16 cases (82.9 +/- 5.4 years old), the minority of E-NFTs were immunoreactive with beta-protein antiserum. These beta-immunoreactive E-NFTs frequently appeared in the areas having senile plaques, while they were not observed in the area lacking beta-immunoreactive senile plaques. The ultrastructure of beta-immunoreactive E-NFTs revealed that they consisted of extracellular amyloid fibrils, extracellularly located bundles of paired helical filaments, astroglial processes and degenerating neurites. These findings suggest that the beta immunoreactivity of E-NFTs comes from secondary deposition of amyloid fibrils."

A joint-movement tracking test (JMTT) quantified control of active finger extension movement at the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger within the available range of active movement, and a force tracking test (FTT) quantified control of isometric finger extension force at the same joint within the subject's available force range. Electromyographic activity was monitored in the extensor digitorum and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles during both tracking tests. Manual stretch was applied to the extrinsic finger flexor muscles of the experimental group between the pretest and posttest tracking tests. The JMTT performances of both control (p less than .025) and experimental (p less than .05) groups were significantly subnormal on the pretest as were FTT performances of controls (p less than .01) and study subjects (p less than .03). The JMTT improvement on posttest was significantly greater (p less than .05) in subjects than in controls. However, the change in FTT performance was not significantly different between the two groups.

All victims suffered massive maxillofacial trauma with associated ocular, cranial, intracranial, and extremity injuries. Two patients died, both because of intracerebral hemorrhage. One patient suffered serious long-term disability. All survivors required extensive reconstructive surgery. The design of the multipiece tire rim is inherently hazardous. Since many accidents of this type are not reported to the NHTSA, the incidence of such injuries may be significantly higher. An alternative, nonhazardous tire rim is available. Design modifications or a law restricting use of multipiece tire rims would prevent many accidents."

    "abstract": "Noninvasive cerebral optical spectroscopy for monitoring cerebral oxygen delivery and hemodynamics. OBJECTIVE: To present an algorithm for noninvasive measurement of cerebral oxygen saturation (cerebral oximetry) and cerebral hemodynamics with near infrared spectroscopy. DESIGN: In vitro correlation of oximetry measurements with reference measurements; illustrative cases of hemodynamic and oximetric recordings. SETTING: Tertiary care neuroscience ICU. PATIENTS: Brain-injured patients with a prolonged, decreased level of consciousness chosen as illustrative examples. INTERVENTIONS: Two-channel multiple wavelength diffuse infrared transmission spectroscopy was interfaced with the scalp using adhesive. Transmission data were collected with gross superficial-to-deep spatial resolution. Saturation calculation based on the deep signal was observed longitudinally in the patient. With the same technology, arterial input and cerebral response functions, generated by iv tracer bolus, were deconvoluted to measure mean cerebral transit time. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A positive linear regression fit between diffuse transmission oximetry and measured blood oxygen saturation over the range 23% to 99% (r2 = .98, p less than .001) was noted. CONCLUSIONS: The approach used overcomes previously identified difficulties with cerebral oximetry, and demonstrates excellent in vitro correlation. The technique can be performed clinically without difficulty. A simultaneous measure of mean cortical transit time is possible."

In a double blind cross-over study, 28 patients, 5 male and 23 female, aged 31 +/- 14 years, after a run-in period of 8 weeks, were treated for 3 months with acetylsalicylic acid and for another 3 months with metoprolol, both in a prophylactic mode. Attack frequency was reduced significantly with both therapeutic regimens (ASA p less than 0.001, metoprolol p less than 0.00005). Reduction of attacks below 50% was seen with metoprolol in 14 cases, and with ASA in three cases. Even though ASA was of statistically significant efficacy in migraine prophylaxis, it clearly is not the drug of first choice in migraine prophylaxis."

Fifty individuals with Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) were studied with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine the frequency and distribution of CNS lesions. The associated clinical features were also reviewed. Thirty-six (72%) of the 50 had 1 or more CNS tumors. The most frequently affected sites in the CNS excluding the retina were the cerebellum (52%), spinal cord (44%), and brainstem (18%). New regional predilections for the craniocervical junction and conus medullaris were demonstrated by this study. Forty-one percent of all VHL patients with CNS tumors were neurologically asymptomatic: cerebellar tumors (50%), spinal cord tumors (50%), and brainstem tumors (44%) were often without clinical signs or symptoms. Multiple lesions were common. The mean age of all VHL patients (34.5 years) was similar to the mean age of all CNS VHL patients (34.4 years), suggesting a lack of age association. CNS lesions commonly occurred in the 2nd decade of life. All patients at risk for VHL should be evaluated using gadolinium-enhanced MRI after 10 years of age, although ophthalmic examination should be initiated within the 1st 2 years of life. Enhanced MRI is particularly useful in the detection of CNS tumors in patients with the VHL gene."

    "abstract": "Infection during chronic epidural catheterization: diagnosis and treatment. A potentially serious complication of long-term epidural catheterization in cancer patients is infection. The early signs of infection were studied in 350 patients in whom long-term epidural catheters were inserted. Three areas of the catheter track were found to be involved; exit site and superficial catheter track infection, and epidural space infection. The authors identified the early signs of infection in each area and the progress of the infection from the deep track to include the epidural space in four of these patients. All 19 patients who developed deep track or epidural infections were successfully treated with antibiotics and catheter removal. None of the patients required surgery for spinal cord decompression. Catheters were replaced in 15 of the 19 treated patients who requested them after treatment with no recurrent infections. It was concluded that use of long-term epidural catheterization is associated with a definable epidural infection rate. The use of epidural opioid analgesia is an effective and safe means of obtaining pain relief for terminally ill patients when patients are monitored for possible infection and receive prompt treatment when the diagnosis is established."

An obese woman with a one-year history of episodic nocturnal chest pain was admitted because of shock and pulmonary edema. A clinical diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock was made. She was ventilated and successfully resuscitated. Subsequent investigations showed no evidence of cardiac dysfunction or coronary disease, but sleep study confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). We suggest that the nocturnal angina and heart failure in this patient might have resulted from extreme hypoxemia produced by OSAS. This case raised the possibility that the high cardiovascular mortality rate reported in OSAS might not necessarily relate to underlying coronary artery disease. Further investigations are required to delineate the true incidence of coronary disease in patients with OSAS."

The clinical, radiographic, and pathological findings in 155 patients with symptomatic Rathke's cleft cysts are discussed. Eight patients were treated by the authors and 147 were collected in a review of the literature. This lesion occurred more often in female than male patients by a 2:1 margin, and the mean age at presentation was 38 years. The average patient had been symptomatic for nearly 3 years at the time of treatment, with the most common symptoms and signs being pituitary dysfunction, visual disturbances, and headaches. Affected children generally were pituitary dwarfs. The sella was enlarged in 80% of cases, and the cyst was situated in both an intrasellar and a suprasellar location in 71%. Computerized tomography revealed a low-density cystic mass with capsular enhancement in one-half of the cases. A variable appearance was seen with magnetic resonance imaging. Partial excision and drainage of the cyst by the transsphenoidal approach is the recommended treatment, as the recurrence rate is low. Most symptoms and signs improved or resolved following surgery with the exception of hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus. The cyst lining was usually composed of ciliated cuboidal or columnar epithelium. Theories as to the origin of Rathke's cleft cysts are also discussed."

The interactive effects of neuro-developmental treatment and inhibitive ankle-height orthoses on gait were examined via a single-subject research design. Knee flexion during gait at initial contact, mid-stance, heel-off, and mid-swing were measured in a 2-year-old girl with diplegia by use of a goniometer and freeze-frame videography. During the treatment and treatment/orthoses phases, a decrease in excessive knee flexion was noted. Changes in trend over time were greater in the 3-week treatment phase than in the 3-week treatment/orthoses phase. Changes in level at the initiation of the treatment/orthoses phase were greater than in the treatment phase. The described neuro-developmental treatment activities were conducted correctly 92% of the time according to an independent observer. The interrater reliability of goniometric data measured by videography was .93 using intraclass correlation coefficients. The results of this study suggest that both methods of treatment can be used to decrease excessive knee flexion during gait in a child with diplegia."

Lateral cerebral ventricular volume in 36 preterm infants with or without an intraventricular hemorrhage, and with or without posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, was measured longitudinally and compared with the ventricular index measurements of the same ventricles. A poor correlation was found (r2 = 0.67). To determine a reason for this poor relationship, we analyzed the volumes of the regions of the ventricles by a segmental volume analysis. The occipital region of the lateral cerebral ventricle enlarged at a much faster rate (1.904 +/- 0.477 ml/day) than either the anterior region (0.546 +/- 0.253 ml/day; p less than 0.01) or the middle region (-0.209 +/- 0.334 ml/day; p less than 0.01) in infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. The rate of growth of the middle region of the lateral cerebral ventricles was the same for all infants. Linear indexes, such as the ventricular index and the lateral ventricular ratio, do not allow for accurate serial estimates of ventricular size in posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus because of asymmetric growth of the lateral cerebral ventricle. We conclude that sequential volume measurements are more useful than ventricular index measurements to follow ventricular size sequentially in infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus."

Thirty-five patients for whom emergency sclerotherapy or conservative treatment, or both, failed to arrest variceal bleeding, or who had early rebleeding and required emergency portosystemic shunts (EPSS) were studied. EPSS permanently controlled the variceal bleeding in all but one patient. In this patient, the shunt was patent as demonstrated by angiography. Esophageal varices disappeared in 18 patients and were reduced in 14. Three patients died before the endoscopic examination could be performed. The causes of death were hepatic failure in two and bleeding ulcerations of the gastric fundus in the other patient. One patient was classified in Child's category B and two in Child's category C. Thirty-two patients submitted to EPSS and were discharged alive. Twelve of these patients subsequently died, at an average of 11.2 months after undergoing the shunt procedure. Four of 12 patients died of hepatic failure; two patients died of hepatomas; two, other neoplasia; three, hemorrhaging duodenal ulcers, and one patient, renal failure. Analysis of actuarial survival rates showed that the five year survival rate was 43 per cent. The long term survival rates were fewer for patients with Child's category C than for those with combined Child's categories A and B (five year survival rates were 21 versus 55 per cent; p less than 0.05). During the follow-up period, none of the patients had variceal bleeding. Chronic encephalopathy developed in six, which was mild in three, moderate in one instance and severe in two. It developed soon after EPSS, with onset in the first month after discharge in three. Thus, when conservative treatment fails to arrest variceal bleeding, EPSS should be performed to guarantee definitive control of hemorrhage and prolong the survival period."

We correlated the postresection electrocorticograms (ECoGs) of 80 patients who underwent temporal lobectomy under general anesthesia for treatment of intractable complex partial seizures with surgical results in three groups: seizure/aura free (32 patients), auras only (16 patients), and one or more postoperative seizures (32 patients) at mean follow-up times of 34, 31, and 38 months, respectively. Spontaneous \"residual spikes,\" ie, present after all resections, were present in 47% of patients who had no postoperative seizures or auras. However, they occurred in 72% of patients with any postoperative seizures (p less than 0.05). The location (convexity, mesial, or edge of resections) or the distribution (unifocal versus multifocal) of the residual spikes was not of prognostic value. Quantitative studies in 5-minute epochs of the postexcision ECoGs did not reveal a significant difference in the morphology of the residual spikes, ie, the amplitude or firing pattern (single versus polyspike), in the three groups. The group with postoperative seizures showed a higher number of spikes per epoch (greater than or equal to 50), but it was not significant. Although the study shows that patients with residual spikes may have good prognosis, they are at significantly higher risk for postoperative seizures as compared with those without residual spikes. The possibility that intensity of firing of residual spikes may be an additional predictor of outcome warrants further study."

When assessed the children were aged 0.47-12.8 years; SD scores were less than -2 for height, weight, and head circumference in all patients. The children had identical facies with deep set eyes, depressed nasal bridge with beaked nose, long philtrum, thin upper lip, micrognathia, and large floppy earlobes. They were all developmentally retarded. The following abnormalities were found on investigation: hypocalcaemia in all (of whom six of seven had hypoparathyroidism), medullary stenosis and other skeletal survey defects in seven of the eight children, and reduced numbers of T cell subsets in four of four tested. We believe that these children represent a new, as yet undescribed genetically determined syndrome."

Articulation, voice, resonance, hearing sensitivity, and middle ear function were examined in 34 patients before and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after orthognathic surgery. Thirty of the 34 patients had articulation errors before surgery. Errors on the sibilants /s/ and /z/ occurred most frequently, followed by those on /j,zh,ch/ and /sh/. Errors were predominantly distortions with both visual and acoustic components. After surgery, articulation improved spontaneously in the absence of intervention. Most of the preoperative articulation errors were eliminated by 3 months postoperative, but, thereafter, a gradual decline was noted so that by 12 months, errors occurred on /s/ and /z/. Voice, resonance, velopharyngeal port area, and hearing sensitivity were not altered by surgery. This study suggests that severe skeletal malocclusions requiring surgical correction have deleterious effects on the patients' articulation of consonants and that surgical alteration leads to the correction of most of these errors."

Samples from 40 pregnancies associated with anencephaly, 47 pregnancies associated with open spina bifida or encephalocele and six pregnancies with fetal intrauterine death or miscarriage all had ratios of greater than 0.14. All 11 pregnancies with fetal ventral wall defects had ratios less than 0.14 as had four pregnancies with normal outcome and elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase. Three fetuses with both open spina bifida and ventral wall defects were associated with ratios above 0.14. These results suggest that immunochemical determination of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase can be used to distinguish pregnancies complicated by anencephaly, open spina bifida, encephalocele and miscarriage from those with ventral wall defects and samples with false positive elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase.

Junior high students (n = 1508) from a midwestern community completed a health behavioral questionnaire that asked the frequency of headache and abdominal pain and of a number of behavioral and emotional risk indicators. Headache (24%) and abdominal pain (13%) were frequently reported among these young adolescents, particularly among girls. Those reporting frequent somatic complaints also reported significantly more behavioral and emotional symptoms indicative of risk (p less than 0.001). Further, the interaction between somatic complaint and gender significantly affected risk status (p less than 0.01). This interaction was greater with behavioral risk: boys with both abdominal pain and headaches reported higher behavioral risk than all other groups (p less than 0.0001). Somatic symptoms continued to account for a significant amount of variance in behavioral risk after the effects of emotional risk and age were removed. This suggests that behavioral risk and emotional risk are independently associated with somatic complaints. The evaluation of persistent somatic complaints in adolescents, particularly in boys with abdominal symptoms, should include careful examination of emotional risk factors and other health-endangering behaviors such as substance use, early sexual activity, and delinquency."

Because flow-volume loops (FVLs) are clinically useful in evaluating upper airway (UA) obstruction and the fact that patency of the nasopharyngeal ventilatory pathway is important to the prevention of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the present study examined the role of nasal compared with oral FVLs in evaluating patients with OSA. Fourteen obese male patients 56 +/- 3 yr of age with a mean apnea plus hypopnea index (AHI) of 51 +/- 9/h were studied along with 14 nonobese, healthy, age- and sex-matched control subjects whose mean AHI was 6 +/- 1/h. Nasal and oral FVLs obtained in the normal subjects indicated the nose behaved like a variable resistor, with flow limitation during inspiration but not during expiration. In the patient group, flow limitation was observed during expiration as well as inspiration indicating nondistensibility of the nasopharyngeal ventilatory pathway in the patients compared to the control subjects. A change in body position from upright to supine in the OSA group was associated with small reductions in expiratory but not inspiratory flow rates. The area under the nasal supine flow-volume loop (FVLANaSup) was found to be highly correlated with awake resting PaO2 (r = 0.80) and PaCO2 (r = -0.83) in the patient group. In addition, multiple linear regression analysis revealed that PaO2 and the area under the nasal FVLs independently contributed to the prediction of AHI with a multiple R of 0.89. These results suggest that limitations to ventilation via the nasopharynx may significantly influence both gas exchange and the frequency of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with OSA."

Clones of hepatitis B virus were propagated from 10 cases of fulminant hepatitis B after amplification by polymerase chain reaction and their nucleotide sequences of the precore region were determined. All 113 clones from 9 cases had a point mutation from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 83 in the precore region, which converted codon 28 for tryptophan (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG) and prohibited the synthesis and secretion of hepatitis B e antigen. Precore-region defects were not detected in any of 23 clones from the remaining 1 case. By contrast, precore-region defects were not found in any of 180 clones from 8 cases of acute hepatitis B without hepatic failure serving as controls. The source of infection was traceable in 3 cases. The same precore-region defect, along with the sequence identity of 435 nucleotides, was observed in clones from the case of a baby and his grandmother, who carried the virus and was implicated in the transmission, and also in clones from two pediatricians and the carrier patients they attended. These findings support the hypothesis that precore-defective mutants have stronger activity to induce fulminant hepatitis than nondefective viruses."

Twelve children had cerebral palsy; 5 children, 4 of whom had cerebral palsy, manifested significant sensory impairments. The median score on cognitive testing was 89; only 2 children exhibited severe-to-profound cognitive disability. Cognitive scores were stable on retesting. The degree of motor disability was correlated with the extent of white matter signal abnormality; however, cognitive outcome was not related to the extent and degree of white matter signal abnormality or to the degree of sulcal prominence.

The concentrations of methanethiol-mixed disulfides, methionine, 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and ammonia were measured in patients with different stages of hepatic encephalopathy, in patients with chronic kidney failure and in healthy subjects. In patients with hepatic encephalopathy, the mean serum concentrations of all these compounds were elevated. However, the elevations of methanethiol-mixed disulfides were small and partly caused by decreased renal function. In addition, the levels of methanethiol-mixed disulfides did not differ significantly between the different grades of hepatic encephalopathy. The concentrations of methanethiol-mixed disulfides were substantially lower than those previously observed in healthy subjects after an oral methionine load or in a patient with a deficiency in methionine adenosyltransferase, the latter without causing encephalopathy. We concluded that the role of methanethiol in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy is probably minor, if not insignificant. In the patients with hepatic encephalopathy, a significant correlation was found between the concentrations of methionine and 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and between 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyrate and methanethiol-mixed disulfides, supporting the theory that methanethiol is formed by way of the methionine transamination pathway. Evidence is provided that, besides the methionine transsulfuration pathway, the transamination pathway is also impaired in patients with hepatic encephalopathy."

Care must be exercised in interpreting the clinical and radiologic findings when assessing patients with cervical spondylosis and involvement of neural structures for surgery. If the clinical picture cannot logically be explained by the radiologic findings, further investigation is indicated to exclude a coexistent disorder. Investigations may include electrophysiologic tests, transcranial magnetic stimulation, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Only then can the indication for surgical intervention be properly determined."

    "abstract": "Cerebral hemodynamics in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus: correlation between cerebral circulation time and dementia. Regional cerebral blood flow and regional cerebral circulation time were measured in 13 demented patients with chronic hydrocephalus, mostly normal pressure hydrocephalus. The average hemispheric, frontal, and temporal cerebral blood flows were significantly reduced. The average regional cerebral circulation time values were significantly prolonged in the frontal, temporal, and thalamic regions, most markedly in the frontal white matter, where periventricular lucency was observed on computed tomography. Clinical improvement was obtained in all patients after operation. While postoperative regional cerebral blood flow values did not change compared with preoperative ones, postoperative regional cerebral circulation time values were significantly reduced in all the regions measured, and most markedly in the frontal white matter. The present results suggest that microcirculation in the frontal lobe is closely correlated with dementia in association with pressure exerted on the nerve fibers in the frontal white matter in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus."

To provide further evidence that the multiple cerebral infarcts found in rats following photochemical damage to the carotid artery are caused by emboli and to eliminate the systemic hypotension and heating of the blood reported with the previous photochemical embolic stroke model (rose bengal and a green laser), I have modified the photochemical technique. Brain pathology was studied in 18 Wistar rats following carotid artery irradiation with a red laser (632 nm) at powers ranging from 100 to 800 mW/cm2 for 10 or 20 minutes following the injection of the photosensitizing dye Photofrin II. Multiple cerebral arterioles were occluded by platelet aggregates containing frequent erythrocytes and leukocytes, identical to the thrombotic material in the carotid artery but different from the platelet aggregates seen in the carotid artery and the brain in the rose bengal model. Eighty infarcts were distributed randomly throughout the brain ipsilateral to the nonocclusive carotid thrombus. Significant heating (0.5 degree C or more) of the blood occurred only with laser powers higher (1,600 mW/cm2) or laser irradiations longer (25 minutes) than those used in the improved model of embolic stroke. This model mimics one mechanism of stroke in humans and provides a means to study systematically the morphological evolution of small cerebral infarcts."

In a double-blind, cross-over trial, progabide (PGB) and placebo were compared as add-on therapy in 59 patients with moderate to severe epilepsy. Eight patients did not complete the study, 4 because of adverse drug reactions (elevation of liver transaminases, 2; gastritis, 1; and acute psychosis, 1) and 4 because of administrative reasons. Among the remaining 51 patients, seizure frequency was reduced greater than 50% in 18 patients with PGB treatment and in 8 patients with placebo (p less than 0.05). The number of days with seizures was significantly (p = 0.034) reduced during PGB treatment. Both patients' and physicians' preferences at the end of the trial were in favor (p less than 0.01) of PGB. Mild clinical side effects were present in 54.7% of the patients treated with PGB and in 37.7% with placebo. Increase in liver transaminases was observed in 2 patients during the double-blind study and in 1 during the follow-up period. Our data show that PGB, as previously reported, is useful in 30-40% of patients who are not responding completely to other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The compound is well tolerated, but liver function must be monitored."

Clinical experience with such drugs suggests that the spinal cord may be one of the important regions from which pathologically increased muscle tone may be relieved. Supraspinal centers that may also be involved in the expression of muscle relaxant action have not yet been defined. We report here that microinjections of therapeutically relevant muscle relaxants into the midbrain tegmentum of genetically spastic rats decrease muscle tone. The substantia nigra is the region from which midazolam, baclofen, and tizanidine (drugs used clinically in the treatment of spasticity), or gamma-vinyl-GABA, (-)-2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoate, and [D-pro2-D-phe7-D-trp9]-substance P (experimental drugs active in animal models of spasticity), reduce muscle tone in genetically spastic rats and Hoffmann reflexes in normal rats. The effects of muscle relaxant drugs are topographically restricted to the substantia nigra pars reticulata and are receptor specific. These observations disclose a previously unknown function of the substantia nigra in mediating muscle relaxation."

Young-onset Parkinson's disease (YOPD) is arbitrarily defined as that which produces initial symptoms between the ages of 21 and 39, inclusive. The special problems and concerns of the patient with YOPD present as much of a challenge and opportunity for the clinician as the disease itself does for the researcher. In contrast to juvenile parkinsonism, which is a heterogeneous group of clinicopathologic entities presenting (also arbitrarily) before age 21, YOPD appears to be the same nosologic entity as older-onset PD. It comprises approximately 5% of referral populations in Western countries and about 10% in Japan. Its annual incidence relative to the population at risk is about 1/10 that of PD at age sixty. YOPD tends to have more gradual progression of parkinsonian signs and symptoms, earlier appearance of levodopa-related dyskinesias and levodopa-dose-related motor fluctuations, and frequent presence of dystonia as an early or presenting sign. Studies conflict with regard to the suspected greater familial frequency and lesser frequency of dementia than in older-onset PD."

We evaluated the clinical response to oligoallergenic dietary treatment and the intestinal absorption of a protein antigen, cow milk beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) in 24 patients with chronic urticaria/angioedema syndrome 13 of whom also suffered from joint symptoms. Sixteen patients (77% of those with arthralgia) responded to diet (RD) with marked reduction of symptoms; the others did not respond (NR). Ten (all but one RD with arthralgia) had increased permeability to BLG after oral administration of cow milk. Four with high titers of IgG to BLG showed the highest absorption of BLG and the groups with arthralgia showed higher BLG levels than those without arthralgia. In all cases, specific IgE to cow milk was absent. These data suggest that the symptoms of a subgroup of patients with chronic urticaria, and especially patients with joint complaints that subside with diet, are related to excess intestinal permeability. The measurement of gut permeability to food proteins may be useful to define those who may benefit from dietary restriction."

Fourteen patients who received at least 4600 cGy to the oral cavity used one of the mouth rinses four times a day, beginning at 1600 cGy. Data were collected on daily perceived pain and helpfulness of mouth rinse, weekly mucositis grade, weight change, and interruption of therapy. Analysis of data revealed no statistically significant differences between the two groups in any parameter. A retrospective review of 15 patients who had received at least 4600 cGy radiation to the oropharynx but had not used a daily mouth-coating rinse, was compared with the study group. Comparison of the two groups suggested that consistent daily oral hygiene and use of a mouth-coating agent will result in less pain and may reduce weight loss and interruption of radiation because of severe mucositis."

The present study investigates this possibility by directly measuring the oxygen tension on the spinal cord surface in pigs. After simple clamping of the aorta, oxygen tension decreased significantly distal to the clamping site both after occlusion of the thoracic aorta at T3-4 (group 1) and after occlusion of the abdominal aorta at L-1 (group 2). Exclusion of the thoracic aorta by a second clamp at T-13 restored oxygen tension almost to the original level, whereas segmentation of the abdominal aorta up to S-1 hardly affected oxygen tension in the area of the artery of Adamkiewicz in most of the animals. We conclude that after aortic cross-clamping, blood tends to drain away from the spinal cord rather than supplying it longitudinally. Without knowledge of the position of the Adamkiewicz artery in humans as well as of the competence of the collateral circulation in the excluded segment, it is necessary to develop a new strategy for repair of the aorta. We describe and discuss two surgical techniques for the prevention of paraplegia after aortic cross-clamping: the counterocclusion technique and the bypass fractionated technique."

The recent increase in popularity of selective posterior rhizotomy demands objective documentation of surgical outcome. For this reason, the authors have analyzed the status of 25 children with spastic cerebral palsy before and after rhizotomy to determine the effects of this therapy on muscle tone, range of movement, and motor function. Postoperative tests showed a reduction in muscle tone compared with preoperative assessments. Range of motion in the lower extremities was significantly increased and improvements in functional gross motor skills were noted. An increase in range of motion in the knees and thighs during gait was detected in 18 ambulatory patients studied with computerized two-dimensional motion analysis. Preliminary findings indicate that selective posterior rhizotomy reduced spasticity, thereby increasing range of motion and contributing to improvements in active functional mobility."

The presenting symptoms and signs of these patients were similar to those reported previously. All the patients were evaluated by pre- and postoperative thin-section, high-resolution computed tomography using soft tissue and bone algorithms. Most of the patients also underwent magnetic resonance imaging. The regions of the clivus involved by tumor were divided into upper, middle, or lower regions on the basis of anatomical landmarks. The diameter of the tumor was measured in three axes, and a tumor volume and a tumor equivalent diameter were computed to categorize tumors as small, medium, large, or giant types. There were 9 medium, 27 large, and 5 giant tumors in this series. Some simple and some complex operative approaches were employed to effect tumor removal. Large and giant tumors often required more than one operative approach to remove the tumor. Intraoperative technical difficulties included tumor consistency, vascularity, dissection from the brain stem, and vascular and cranial nerve encasement. Postoperative computed tomographic scans documented total excision in 32 patients (78%). Residual tumor remained in the clival or cavernous sinus areas. These patients were either being observed, or were treated with gamma knife radiosurgery. There was one operative death due to pneumonia (2%), and three patients (7%) suffered permanent major neurological changes, presumably due to vascular occlusions in the posterior circulation. In the follow-up period, which ranged from 3 to 76 months, 2 patients (6%) with tumors that had appeared to be totally excised experienced recurrence. These patients were treated by a second operation, alone or in combination with radiation therapy. Two patients who had subtotal excisions (25%) had evidence of regrowth. In 2 patients, tumor growth continued despite gamma knife radiosurgery or external beam radiotherapy."

Thirty-eight healthy outpatients undergoing elective surgical procedures lasting 1-3 h were randomly assigned to receive either desflurane 3% (approximately 0.5 MAC) or isoflurane 0.6% (approximately 0.5 MAC) for maintenance of general anesthesia with nitrous oxide 60% in oxygen after a standardized induction sequence consisting of fentanyl 3 micrograms.kg-1, thiopental 4 mg.kg-1, and succinylcholine 1-1.5 mg.kg-1, intravenously. Although anesthetic conditions were similar during operations in the two treatment groups, significant differences were noted in the recovery profiles as measured by elimination kinetics, psychometric testing, and visual analog scales (to assess subjective feelings). The time required for the end-tidal concentration to decrease by 50% was 2.5 +/- 0.8 min for desflurane vs. 9.5 +/- 3.4 min for isoflurane (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]). Times to awakening and ability to follow simple commands were significantly shorter after desflurane than after isoflurane (5.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 10.2 +/- 7.7 min 6.5 +/- 2.3 min vs. 11.1 +/- 7.9 min, respectively). Postoperatively, patients who received desflurane exhibited less impairment of cognitive function (as measured using the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test) than did those who received isoflurane. Furthermore, visual analog scores indicated that patients receiving desflurane experienced significantly less discomfort (pain), drowsiness, fatigue, clumsiness, and confusion in the early postoperative period. We conclude that desflurane may offer clinical advantages over isoflurane when used for maintenance of anesthesia during outpatient surgical procedures."

Four per cent (n = 1008) of 24,899 admissions to the MICU were treated with MV. The mean age of ventilator-treated patients was 53 +/- 18 years, and obviously it increased during the period of study.

The mortality rate did not change during the study period. Cerebrovascular and malignant diseases carried the highest mortality rates, 75 and 79%, respectively, whereas mortality in patients ventilated because of drug overdose (n = 313) was only 2%. The results of this study confirm previously published findings concerning the outcome of MV, and we conclude that the effects of MV remain discouraging in medical and neurological patients. Improved quality of ventilator therapy and monitoring, as well as continued research directed at the causes of ARF, are equally important in reducing the mortality in ARF."

Patients with H influenzae bacteremia were more likely to have soft-tissue foci, poorer clinical appearance at presentation, and be at higher risk for subsequent serious focal infections, persistent bacteremia, and subsequent hospital admissions than patients with S pneumoniae. Patients with H influenzae bacteremia had a 21.1-fold increase in risk of meningitis (95% confidence interval [CI] of 3.8 to 78.0) compared with those with S pneumoniae. The odds ratio for initial lumbar puncture was 5.25 (95% CI [1.1-23.6]). Ambulatory patients treated with antibiotics at presentation were less likely to develop new serious soft-tissue infections, persistent bacteremia, or to require subsequent hospital admissions than untreated patients. The effect of treatment was greater for patients with S pneumoniae than those with H influenzae. Careful follow-up and reevaluation of patients with presumptive bacteremia is essential because treated and untreated patients can still develop serious soft-tissue infections."

Acoustic neuromas occur either as sporadic solitary tumors in the general population or as inherited bilateral tumors typically in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2. Loss of heterozygosity for markers on the long arm of chromosome 22 has been reported in both instances, and neurofibromatosis type 2 has been genetically linked to a marker on the long arm of this autosome, suggesting that a unique locus on chromosome 22 is implicated in tumorigenesis of both sporadic and inherited acoustic neuromas. To determine whether the locus for neurofibromatosis type 2 might also be responsible for tumorigenesis of those schwannomas distinct from acoustic neuromas in people without neurofibromatosis type 2, we studied the DNA content of three sporadic spinal schwannomas. In all three, we found loss of heterozygosity for at least three markers on the long arm of chromosome 22, indicating a partial or total monosomy 22 in the tumor. Our results suggest that a locus on chromosome 22 is responsible for tumorigenesis in schwann cells regardless of their location in the central nervous system, and that some other mechanism (genetic or nongenetic) might account for the relative high proportion of schwannomas developing from the eighth cranial nerve."

Moreover the calcium sensitivity of the myofilament appeared modified in the soleus and in the gastrocnemius: The tension/pCa relationships were shifted toward higher calcium concentrations, indicating a decrease in the apparent calcium binding constant of the troponin C.

This review will concentrate on three important risk factors: elevated blood pressure, the most common and important, since it is responsible for up to 70% of all strokes; raised cholesterol; and smoking. These factors are important not only because they increase the risk of stroke, but also because they are amenable to modification by drugs, diet, or other interventions. Strategies to avoid stroke can either 1) try to produce substantial reductions, usually with drugs, in the level of the risk factor in the few individuals in the population with high levels (the \"high-risk\" approach), or 2) try to produce modest reductions in the level of the risk factor in every individual in the population, usually not with drugs but with lifestyle modification (the \"mass\" approach). The prevention of stroke could best be achieved through continuing medical efforts to deal with high-risk individuals and through political strategies to encourage a healthier lifestyle in the population as a whole."

Encephalitogenic T cells specific for myelin basic protein share common V beta 8 peptide sequences in their T cell receptor (TCR) that can induce autoregulatory T cells and antibodies that prevent clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). It is not known, however, if TCR peptides can treat established disease. To test its therapeutic value, TCR-V beta 8-39-59 peptide was injected into rats with clinical signs of EAE. This treatment reduced disease severity and speeded recovery, apparently by boosting anti-V beta 8 T cells and antibodies raised naturally in response to encephalitogenic V beta 8+ T cells. These results demonstrate that synthetic TCR peptides can be used therapeutically, and implicate the TCR-V beta 8-39-59 sequence as a natural idiotope involved in EAE recovery.

Eight of them had aphasia or neglect. All patients underwent transcranial Doppler ultrasonography or selective carotid angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and single photon emission tomography for assessment of cerebral blood flow, blood volume, and cerebral perfusion reserve. The signs were compatible with cortical territorial infarctions rather than lacunes. On both magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic scans, the lesions corresponded to the territories of the medial and lateral group of the lenticulostriate arteries, Heubner's artery, or the anterior choroidal artery. The infarctions were either due to cerebral embolization into the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery or due to stenosis at the same site, ie, lesions that acutely and simultaneously occluded the orifices of the lenticulostriate or neighboring arteries. Persistent occlusion of the middle cerebral arteries and a decrease of cortical regional cerebral blood flow were only found in patients with aphasia or neglect. All patients without aphasia or neglect showed a rapid recanalization of the middle cerebral artery occlusion or a stenosis of the M1 segment and no cortical regional cerebral blood flow decrease. Large striatocapsular infarctions occur due to occlusive disease of the middle cerebral artery (large-vessel disease) and not due to a disseminated in situ occlusion of the long penetrating arteries (small-vessel disease), as in lacunes. Neuropsychological deficits can be explained by decreased cortical blood flow due to a persistent occlusive lesion of the middle cerebral artery."

The average age of the patients was 50 years (range, 23-75 years). All patients were followed for an average of eight years (range, three to 13 years). At final evaluation, no or slight pain was present in 77% of the shoulders: 39 of 50 without tendon tearing and 12 of 16 with tendon tearing and repair. Active shoulder abduction averaged 167 degrees. Ninety-two percent returned to employment, including 18% with some job modification. Eighty-six percent returned to recreational athletics, 20% with some modification of activities. Seven patients had additional surgical treatment. The progression of rotator cuff disease is not always prevented, but the need for subsequent shoulder treatment generally decreases."

Intellectual deterioration ranged from moderate to severe, and diffuse cerebral or cerebellar atrophy was found on brain CT. Diagnosis of CD was confirmed by findings of subtotal villous atrophy in jejunal biopsy specimens and positive serum reticulin and gliadin antibodies. Conspicuously, gastrointestinal symptoms were mild. The gluten-free diet failed to improve the neurologic disability except in 1 patient. CD is a multisystem disorder and may play a role in some cases of presenile dementia. Although the pathogenetic mechanisms are obscure, immunologic mechanisms are implicated."

    "abstract": "Cardiopulmonary perfusion and cerebral blood flow in bilateral carotid artery disease The fear of cerebral complications after cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with heart disease and severe carotid artery disease has led many authors to suggest combined approaches in these patients. The pathogenetic mechanism for stroke is based partly on the stenotic narrowing of the carotid artery. A diameter reduction of 75% is frequently considered hemodynamically significant and indicative of an increased risk for neurological morbidity. We studied the cerebral blood flow in 7 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting who also had severe bilateral carotid disease. The results were compared with the results in 17 patients without carotid disease who had bypass grafting. The cerebral blood flow was measured by xenon 133 washout technique before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia. Acid-base regulation was according to the alpha-stat theory, and blood pressure was kept greater than 50 mm Hg. The cerebral blood flow levels (mL.100g-1.min-1) before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass in the study group (30 +/- 11, 31 +/- 8, 47 +/- 20) (mean +/- standard deviation) were almost identical to those in the control group (30 +/- 11, 28 +/- 8, 47 +/- 12). The cerebral blood flow levels for the left and right hemispheres in the group with carotid disease were comparable and within normal ranges. In 2 patients, slight differences were noted between hemispheres, and this finding may indicate an increased risk for ischemia. These patients, however, did not show any signs of postoperative deficit. The flow limitations of critical carotid stenoses do not seem to imply a risk for cerebral hypoperfusion if cardiopulmonary perfusion is performed in a controlled manner."

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of nimodipine on infarct development and local brain pH after middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. Female Fischer-344 rats were subjected to permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery by electrocoagulation. After 6, 12, or 24 hours, brains were frozen, and infarct size, degree of edema formation, and local brain pH were quantified by standard histology or the umbelliferone technique, respectively. In control rats, cortical infarct size was increased from 29.5 microliters at 6 hours to 72.5 microliters at 24 hours after vessel occlusion. In striatum only, an insignificant increase from 15.2 to 24.7 microliters in infarct volume was observed during this period. Edema increased from 7% to 22% in cortical and from 4% to 39% in the striatal infarct areas during this time. Nimodipine (0.1 mg/kg s.c.), given 45 minutes before and again 8 and 16 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion, did not alter infarct size at 6 hours but considerably improved outcome at later times. Edema formation was lower at 12 hours in the group treated with the calcium antagonist (p less than 0.05). By contrast, effects on local brain pH were seen as early as 6 hours after the vessel occlusion. Nimodipine greatly reduced the areas exhibiting the lowest pH values beyond pH 6.0 (p less than 0.05). Similar effects by nimodipine on brain pH were observed in the 12-hour series, whereas at 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion, a shift to more alkalotic values was noted with no overt differences between control and drug-treated groups."

Lesions associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. One hundred neonates determined prospectively to be at risk for neurologic handicap underwent magnetic resonance imaging with a high-field (1.5 T) imager. Thirty-three demonstrated a total of 37 lesions consistent with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, including periventricular leukomalacia (n = 12), basal ganglia hemorrhage (n = 5), multicystic encephalomalacia (n = 5), and focal parenchymal hemorrhage (n = 15). Diagnoses by ultrasonography and computed tomography were compared with those by magnetic resonance imaging in 29 and 17 infants, respectively. Ultrasonography agreed more frequently with magnetic resonance imaging than did computed tomography. Ultrasonography detected 79% of lesions demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging whereas computed tomography detected only 41%. Periventricular leukomalacia was seen most often in preterm infants, basal ganglia hemorrhage and multicystic encephalomalacia primarily occurred in term infants, and focal parenchymal hemorrhage occurred at all gestational ages. Basal ganglia hemorrhage and multicystic encephalomalacia were strongly associated with histories of perinatal asphyxia, seizures, and early abnormal neurological status. All infants with basal ganglia hemorrhage (5/5) and multicystic encephalomalacia (5/5) and the majority with periventricular leukomalacia (9/12) and focal parenchymal hemorrhages (9/15) had developmental abnormalities at discharge."

Assay of anti-striated muscle antibodies (StrAb) is used as a diagnostic test for thymoma in individuals with myasthenia gravis. Unfortunately, false positive results are common, and their effect on test accuracy is magnified by the relatively low frequency of thymoma in myasthenics. We estimated the predictive values of positive and negative StrAb assays (PV+ and PV-) and gain in diagnostic certainty using values for sensitivity, specificity, and thymoma frequency previously reported in the literature. Sensitivity for indirect immunofluorescence assays ranged from 0.83 to 0.84 (pooled estimate = 0.84; n = 68). Specificity ranged from 0.73 to 0.88 (pooled estimate = 0.77; n = 898). Frequency of thymoma ranged from 0.07 to 0.17 (pooled estimate = 0.12; n = 4,515). The expected gain in diagnostic certainty from StrAb was minimal in those aged 0 to 20 and those aged 60+. In those aged 20 to 60, a negative test helped to exclude thymoma, and a positive test raised diagnostic suspicion but was not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of thymoma (PV+ = 0.46)."

The disease is a multisystem disorder with a metabolic defect located at complex 1 in the respiratory chain. Clinically, the disorder gives symptoms such as hearing loss, retinal pigmental degeneration, ataxia, cardiomyopathy, muscular fatiguability and neuropathy. The patients were investigated with nerve conduction studies, concentric needle EMG, SFEMG, and macro EMG examinations. Neurophysiologic studies revealed signs of myopathy in both the younger members and in those with slight muscular symptoms. In the more advanced stages, neuropathic changes of the axonal type were seen as well. Macro EMG was interpreted as indicating muscle fiber membrane abnormalities in the early stages. Single fiber EMG studies indicate that this metabolic defect does not disturb neuromuscular transmission."

The knee score improved from a preoperative average of 35 points to a postoperative average of 90 points in the cemented group, and from 38 points to 93 points in the uncemented group. In particular, the individual pain scores and the range-of-motion values were well matched at the three-, six-, and 12-month follow-up visits and showed a steady improvement. Subjectively, all patients were pleased with the results of surgery; one-third preferred the cemented side, one-third preferred the uncemented side, and one-third found no difference in the performance of either knee. The clinical and functional performance of knee prostheses in patients who had one cemented knee and one uncemented knee were comparable and possibly unrelated to the type of fixation method."

Twelve infants (six boys, six girls) with severe hypocalcaemic tetany or convulsions were seen over a three year period. Nine patients were symptomatic in the newborn period. Their hypocalcaemia was associated with hyperphosphataemia and very low concentrations of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone. None of the babies suffered from congenital cardiac disease. Cell mediated immunity, measured in five patients, was normal. There were no chromosomal abnormalities but all patients shared several dysmorphic features including deep set eyes, microcephaly, thin lips, beaked nose tip, external ear anomalies, micrognathia, and depressed nasal bridge. Mental retardation of varying degree was found in all patients. All had severe intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation. Four patients have died. The remaining eight patients are on treatments with vitamin D and calcium supplements with no change in their growth pattern. We believe that this association of congenital hypoparathyroidism with severe growth failure and dysmorphism represents a new syndrome."

To determine whether correction for preterm birth should be applied during developmental assessment, we conducted a prospective national survey of very premature infants (born at less than 32 weeks of gestation); neurodevelopment in the first 2 years was studied with the Dutch child health care developmental assessment. In 555 preterm children who had no evidence of handicap at 2 years of age, the age at which developmental milestones were reached was established. The results were compared with the results of the same assessment in Dutch children born at term. During the first year, the development of the very premature children equaled the development of normal children when full correction was applied. At 2 years of age, development was equal to or better than normal children's development without correction. We conclude that full correction for prematurity should be applied in the first year to avoid overreferral for developmental stimulation, whereas at 2 years of age correction is not necessary."

PURPOSE: The risks of alcohol consumption and its association with stroke were studied in 621 patients with stroke and 573 control subjects using case-control methods. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stroke were subdivided into 193 with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 91 with intracerebral hemorrhage, and 337 with cerebral infarction. Data on recent alcohol consumption were obtained by questionnaire in patients with stroke and compared with data from an occupational screening survey in control subjects. RESULTS: Relative risks, adjusted for confounding variables, exhibited J-shaped associations with increasing levels of alcohol consumption classified into four categories--abstainer, 1 to 90 g, 100 to 390 g, and greater than or equal to 400 g weekly). The individual risks were 1, 0.7, 0.5, and 1.3 for subarachnoid hemorrhage; 1.0, 0.6, 0.5., and 2.5 for intracerebral hemorrhage, and 1.0, 0.6, 0.7, and 2.4 for cerebral infarction for men and women combined. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that low levels of alcohol consumption may have some protective effect upon the cerebral vasculature, whereas heavy consumption predisposes to both hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic stroke."

DESIGN: Prospective clinical trial. SETTING: Prehospital in a busy, urban emergency medical services system. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Fifty consecutive patients presenting with documented hypoglycemia (ChemStrip BG less than or equal to 80 mg/dL) and symptoms of decreased level of consciousness, syncope, or seizure were enrolled. MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: Data collected included pretreatment (ChemStrip BG) and post-treatment serum glucose (hospital assay) as well as assessment of level of consciousness by a quantitative measure, the Glasgow Coma Score, and by a qualitative scale (0 to 3). The mean pretreatment blood glucose of 33.2 +/- 23.3 mg/dL increased after treatment to 133.3 +/- 57.3 mg/dL. Qualitative level of consciousness increased from a mean of 1.26 +/- .96 to 2.42 +/- .94 and Glasgow Coma Score increased from a mean of 9.0 +/- 4.19 to 13.04 +/- 3.68. The mean time until response was 8.8 minutes in those who responded to both level of consciousness criteria 82% (41 of 50). Glucagon administered for hypoglycemia resulted in a glucose increase in 98% (49 of 50) with headache as the only side effect noted in 4% (two of 50) of patients (P less than .0001). CONCLUSION: Glucagon is safe and effective therapy for hypoglycemia in the prehospital setting."

In 1989, the Centers for Disease Control recognized the existence of an epidemic illness characterized by myalgia and eosinophilia in individuals taking preparations containing L-tryptophan. We evaluated 3 patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome who presented with subacute progressive neuropathies. The neuropathies were predominantly motor and maximal in the lower extremities. Two patients were confined to a wheelchair and one was ventilator-dependent and bedridden. Sensory loss predominantly involved small fiber modalities. Electrophysiological studies showed multifocal marked conduction slowing and conduction block indicating segmental demyelination, with associated axonal degeneration that was accentuated distally. Examination of sural nerve biopsy specimens demonstrated axonal degeneration in all 3 patients and perivascular infiltrates in 2. Levels of quinolinic acid, a neurotoxic metabolite of L-tryptophan, were elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid in the 2 patients in whom it was measured. The cause of the neuropathy is unknown but may include immune mechanisms or toxicity of eosinophils, L-tryptophan, its metabolic products, or contaminants within L-tryptophan preparations."

The left gastrocnemius was denervated by a 75-80% lesion of the sciatic nerve. The effective dose for 95% twitch depression (ED95) was studied in the denervated gastrocnemius and compared to the contralateral undenervated and sham-injured (control) gastrocnemius muscles approximately 2 weeks after injury. The AChR number was quantitated by the specific ligand 125I-alpha-bungarotoxin (125I-alpha-BT). Plasma dTC concentrations, measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), were correlated to twitch tension during spontaneous recovery from neuromuscular blockade in the denervated animal. The ED95 (mean +/- SE) of dTC for the denervated leg was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher (0.26 +/- 0.06 mg.kg-1) than contralateral (0.16 +/- 0.03) and sham-operated left (0.13 +/- 0.03) legs. The twitch tension recovered to 50% of control twitch height at significantly (P less than 0.05) higher plasma dTC concentrations in the denervated (0.78 micrograms.ml-1) compared to contralateral (0.24 micrograms.ml-1) limb. The AChR number was significantly increased in the denervated limb (1041 +/- 96 fmol.mg protein-1) compared to contralateral right (109 +/- 4) and control left limb (113 +/- 11). There was a significant (P less than 0.05) positive correlation (R2 = 0.73) between ED95 and AChR number; that is, 73% of the variability in ED95 could be explained by changes in AChR. This study, therefore, confirms the hypothesis that proliferation of AChR after nerve denervation results in resistance to the neuromuscular effects of dTC."

DATA SOURCE AND SELECTION: All articles on OSA published in French and English between 1970 and 1990 and indexed in Index Medicus were reviewed. Studies addressing the epidemiologic features and clinical aspects of OSA were selected, and special emphasis was given to articles reporting the effects of treatment on morbidity and mortality rates. MAIN RESULTS: OSA is characterized by episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep that result in repetitive hypoxemia and sleep disruption. OSA leads to various neuropsychologic and cardiovascular complications, including daytime hypersomnolence, cognitive impairment, systemic and pulmonary hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias. There is suggestive evidence that the death rate among affected people is increased. The true incidence of OSA is unknown, but estimates have varied from 1% upwards among men. The current treatment with the greatest overall effectiveness and acceptability is nasal continuous positive airway pressure. CONCLUSION: This common, readily treatable disorder is associated with serious complications and therefore must be widely recognized by health professionals."

The intracarotid amobarbital sodium, or Wada, test has been used to localize speech and memory function prior to surgical treatment of temporal lobe seizures. The authors mixed technetium-99m hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) with amobarbital sodium and injected the mixture in 25 patients with epilepsy. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain was then performed to determine intracerebral distribution of the amobarbital sodium. Results of SPECT were compared with those of conventional and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The distribution of Tc-99m HMPAO and, presumably, amobarbital sodium varied from patient to patient. SPECT revealed a statistically different distribution from that predicted with conventional angiography. The distribution also often differed from that of DSA, although the difference was not significant. SPECT revealed infrequent delivery to mesial temporal lobe structures. This emphasizes the need for caution in the use of the intracarotid amobarbital sodium test to predict the outcome of removal of these areas."

Both acidic and basic forms of fibroblast growth factor are found in the mammalian brain. We have examined the expression of these factors after focal brain injury or stroke. After infarction of the lateral cerebral cortex in the mature rat brain, we found a twofold to threefold increase during the first 3 weeks after stroke in levels of fibroblast growth factors in tissue surrounding infarcts. This increase persisted for at least 2 months and appeared mainly to be due to increased levels of basic, but not acidic, fibroblast growth factor. Because of its gliotrophic, angiogenic, and neuronotrophic properties, basic fibroblast growth factor may play an important role in the cascade of cellular reactions that contributes to wound healing and functional recovery after stroke."

Measurement of serum prolactin levels can be useful in the diagnosis of epilepsy, since prolactin levels often rise after seizures, but not after most imitators of epilepsy. Utility of the test is limited by the need to obtain blood 10 to 20 minutes after the episode. The present study documents the validity of prolactin measurements using capillary blood, which was obtained by the finger-stick method after a possible seizure and then applied to filter paper. Venous and capillary prolactin levels were determined 10 to 20 minutes after seizure-like episodes in 20 patients who were studied in an epilepsy monitoring unit. Venous and capillary prolactin values correlated, with a Pearson coefficient of 0.90. Using a criteria of any elevation above the laboratory upper limit of normal, capillary prolactin values correctly identified seizure versus pseudoseizure in 9 (100%) of 9 patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, in 5 (71%) of 7 patients with complex partial seizures, and 4 (100%) of 4 patients with pseudoseizures. Prolactin values were unaffected by leaving filter paper samples at room temperature for up to 1 week. This study suggests the utility of diagnostic capillary blood collection kits to assist in the diagnosis of epilepsy in outpatients."

Eighty-two consecutive Child-Campbell class A and B cirrhotic patients were included in a prospective controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of portacaval anastomosis vs. endoscopic sclerotherapy as elective treatment of variceal hemorrhage. Forty-one patients were randomized to portacaval anastomosis and 41 to sclerotherapy. After excluding dropouts, 34 patients were treated with portacaval anastomosis and 35 with sclerotherapy. The incidence of variceal rebleeding during follow-up (mean +/- SD, 20.6 +/- 14.2 months) was significantly higher in the sclerotherapy than in the portacaval groups, either considering the overall treated group or only patients completing sclerotherapy (40% and 25% vs. 2.9%; P = 0.0002 and P = 0.01, respectively). The 2-year probability of suffering from at least one episode of hepatic encephalopathy was significantly higher in patients submitted to portacaval anastomosis than in those treated with endoscopic sclerotherapy (40% vs. 12%; P = 0.04). However, disabling encephalopathy only appeared in 3 of 34 patients who underwent surgery (8.8%). Early and long-term mortality did not differ between the therapeutic groups; 2-year survival rates were 83% for portacaval anastomosis and 79% for sclerotherapy. It is concluded that portacaval anastomosis is more effective than endoscopic sclerotherapy in preventing variceal rebleeding in spite of the greater incidence of hepatic encephalopathy. The role of portacaval anastomosis in the elective treatment of variceal rebleeding should be reassessed."

Three patients developed akinetic mutism on the third day after the introduction of intravenous cyclosporin A, given for immunosuppression after liver transplantation. One patient in addition developed a florid orofacial dyskinesia, which resolved completely, as did the akinetic mutism, after withdrawal of cyclosporin. In these patients the time course of the akinetic mutism and extrapyramidal syndrome, which developed in the absence of any other identifiable cause, suggests cyclosporin A was the precipitating factor. Subsequently, two of the patients showed signs of pseudobulbar palsy with abnormalities in the pons on MRI scanning, suggesting central pontine myelinolysis (CPM). None of the patients had experienced significant fluctuations in serum sodium or other risk factors for central pontine myelinolysis and the exact relationship to the earlier cyclosporin related mutism was not clear."

Because of the varied clinical manifestations of this illness and the use of unstandardized serologic testing methods, diagnosis is often uncertain and treatment outcomes are often difficult to evaluate. The antibiotic regimens that are commonly used in clinical practice have changed rapidly. They show much regional variation with little critical comparison of treatment results. The clinical diagnosis and the literature on the treatment of the various stages of Lyme disease are reviewed. The reported data are supplemented with recommendations based on 15 years of clinical experience with this illness."

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography should not be routine in the evaluation of syncope in adults We reviewed the reports of all electroencephalograms obtained at the Nashville (Tenn) Veterans Administration Hospital from September 1987 to August 1989. Seventy-three patients were referred for evaluation of syncope or near syncope. Of these 73 patients, 10 (13.7%) had abnormal findings. Twenty-six patients were referred for other complaints similar to syncope (ie, blackouts, loss of consciousness, falling out, passing out, and fainting). Of these 26 patients, five (19.2%) had abnormal findings. We reviewed the medical records of the patients with abnormal findings and found that the final diagnosis or treatment of the syncope was affected by electroencephalogram in only one patient. These findings suggest that routine electroencephalography is not of significant value in the evaluation of syncope in adults."

The patient presenting with severe bone pain after primary hormonal therapy, with vertebral collapse, or with uremia resulting from ureteric obstruction should be considered for intravenous stilbestrol diphosphate therapy. The urologist can expect early marked improvement in the patients' mobility and pain, with a reduction in analgesic requirements, from a single 7-day course of treatment. In addition, the drug is inexpensive and free of the side effects commonly associated with cytotoxic therapy. Accurate monitoring of the response is possible with serum prostate-specific antigen measurements, which also enable further therapy to be planned efficiently."

Thirty-eight parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias on chronic levodopa therapy were treated with subcutaneous lisuride infusion (SLI). Thirty-six were discharged from hospital on combined treatment with 24 h lisuride infusion (111.3 +/- 29.5 micrograms/h) and oral levodopa plus a decarboxylase inhibitor (729.6 +/- 452 mg/day); all obtained a marked initial improvement in mobility (mean reduction 'off' hours 87.5%); 34 were followed for a mean of 20.85 (range 6-45) months. Most patients continued to show improvement with respect to baseline assessment during chronic treatment but 23 developed dyskinesias, 'off' periods or both, which were difficult to control by changing the levodopa schedule, lisuride dose or both. In only 5 patients was lisuride treatment stopped because of inefficacy. The high incidence of psychiatric side-effects (18/38) was the major limiting factor for continuing lisuride infusion in this population of severe parkinsonian patients. Many complained about the inconvenience of the pump's technical requirements for long-term utilization, but only 4 patients abandoned SLI for this reason. These results indicate that motor function may be substantially improved in severe parkinsonian patients treated with SLI but increased dyskinesia or psychiatric adverse effects limited the long-term usefulness of this approach. It is suggested that continuous dopaminergic stimulation may be a particularly useful therapeutic strategy when applied in earlier stages of the disease."

Experimental studies in rodents show that beta-nerve growth factor can increase the survival, neurite outgrowth, and functional effect of grafts of adrenal chromaffin cells to the basal ganglia. We, therefore, have begun to investigate whether treatment with nerve growth factor might also increase the functional effect of autografts of adrenal medullary tissue in patients with Parkinson's disease. Previous studies have shown that stereotactic implantation of adrenal tissue pieces produces a transient functional improvement that lasts for a few months. This report describes a trial of grafting of adrenal chromaffin tissue into the putamen, supported by infusion of nerve growth factor. The patient is a 63-year-old woman with a 19-year history of Parkinson's disease, now complicated by on-off phenomena and drug-induced hyperkinesia, despite optimized medical management. The left adrenal gland was removed, and the medulla was dissected into 1- to 2-mm3 pieces in a solution containing nerve growth factor purified from mouse submandibular gland. Pieces were implanted in six tracts 3 to 4 mm from a previously placed cannula in the left putamen. Through the cannula, nerve growth factor was infused for 23 days for a total dose of 3.3 mg. Clinical assessment consisted of global ratings for rigidity and/or hypokinesia and for drug-induced hyperkinesia. Measures of gait and fine-motor control were also made. The motor readiness potential and auditory evoked potentials were recorded."

Higher preoperative performances on the memory and language measures were associated with larger decrements in postsurgical scores among the LTL patients. The RTL group showed no consistent relationship between preoperative ability levels and subsequent postsurgical cognitive changes. Based on the present data, we constructed base-rate tables for the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised indicating the likelihood of measurable gains or losses in memory as a function of presurgical ability level for patients undergoing LTL. While tentative, these data provide a useful and practical guide for counseling prospective epilepsy patients of the attendant cognitive risks of LTL."

    "abstract": "Neglected factors in chronic pain treatment outcome studies--referral patterns, failure to enter treatment, and attrition. An increasing number of chronic pain treatment outcome studies have appeared in the literature. In general, these studies support the efficacy of multidisciplinary pain programs, as well as specific treatment modalities such as biofeedback and relaxation. Reviews of this literature have tended to be cautiously optimistic. Some concerns, however, have been raised about the methodological adequacy of these studies, particularly in terms of the lack of control groups, the brief duration of follow-up periods, and the vague criteria used for establishing the success of the therapeutic interventions. Other factors that mitigate conclusions regarding the generalizability of the favorable results reported need to be considered. In this paper 3 rarely discussed topics that are implicit within most treatment outcome studies and that need to be given greater attention are examined. These topics include: (1) referral patterns to pain clinics (who are referred to pain clinics, when, and how representative is the referred sample?); (2) failure to enter treatment (e.g., exclusion criteria, lack of available financial support to cover the cost of treatment, patient's refusal to accept recommendations), and consequently, the representativeness of the treated sample; and (3) patient's attrition. In this paper we discuss each of these factors as they underscore important qualifications that have to be made in evaluating treatment outcome studies."

To clarify the mechanisms involved in the ventilatory response to the inhalation of low concentrations of CO (0.18-0.22% in air), the roles of the arterial chemoreceptors and the forebrain structures have been investigated in unanesthetized adult cats. The ventilatory response was observed in conscious animals intact, after carotid denervation (CD), and after midcollicular decerebration. The results show that the initial small ventilatory depression was unaffected by CD but that the subsequent characteristic tachypnea was blunted after CD even after more prolonged exposure to CO. The CO tachypnea was not observed after decerebration, but a residual hyperventilation was noted with the higher concentration used. It may be concluded that carotid chemoreceptors do not mediate the CO tachypnea, which may then originate in suprapontine structures as shown by comparison of intact and decerebrate animals. The blunting of the tachypnea after CD may be caused by the relative hypercapnia observed in CD animals. The residual hyperventilation observed in decerebrate animals may be caused by central acidosis and/or some peripheral potentiation of chemoreceptor activity resulting from the decrease in arterial blood pressure that accompanied CO inhalation in decerebrate animals."

During 1 year we monitored changes in clinical disability scores in 10 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who sustained head trauma from motor vehicle accidents. Disability significantly increased immediately after trauma, but returned to baseline levels in subsequent weeks. These patients' signs deteriorated over the subsequent year, but this decline was equivalent to that of a matched control group with PD who did not have a motor vehicle accident or trauma. Based on these data, we conclude that trauma or stress caused by motor vehicle accidents can transiently exacerbate parkinsonian dysfunction without causing persistent increased disability or an alteration in disease course."

In 232 newborn babies of less than 32 weeks' gestational age ultrasound brain scans were carried out shortly after birth, daily for the first week of life, and at least twice weekly thereafter. Periventricular echogenicity associated with or progressing to periventricular leukomalacia (ischaemic brain lesions) was present in nine babies within two hours of birth (early onset); 30 other babies subsequently developed similar lesions (late onset). Babies with early onset lesions were more likely to have a history of intrauterine growth retardation and to have recurrent apnoea in the first few hours after birth. By contrast, late onset lesions were associated with hyaline membrane disease. In later childhood four of six survivors with early onset periventricular leukomalacia, and seven of 14 survivors with late onset periventricular leukomalacia, had various disabilities including spastic diplegia, impaired vision, squints, sensorineural hearing loss, and developmental delay. In a third of the children with disabilities ischaemic brain lesions were noted within two hours of birth, raising the possibility that some of this damage had taken place before or during birth."

An extracorporeal liver perfusion system was designed to maintain cadaver livers in an oxygenated, normothermic state for bridging procedures for hepatic transplantation. Nonpulsatile high flow and pulsatile low flow blood are supplied to the portal venous (PV) and hepatic arterial (HA) circulations. Controlled low blood flow (5-10 cc/kg [patient]/min) is exchanged between the high flow extracorporeal perfusion circuit (1 cc/g [liver]/min) and the patient. The system was evaluated in perfusions of fresh, excised pig livers (n = 5). The average oxygen consumption was 9 +/- 3 microliters/g/min, and bile production averaged 4.7 microliters/g/hr. Perfusion pressures and flows were normal in both the HA and PV circulations for about 4 hr. Pressures then gradually rose, especially in the HA circulation, causing flow to decrease, with subsequent mottling and discoloration of the liver. Red blood cell, platelet, and white blood cell counts fell continuously. Maintenance of liver function was assessed by clearance of an 80 mg taurocholic acid challenge. An average of 56% of injected acid was cleared from the perfused livers (n = 5) in the first half hour, compared with 90% and 25% for the in situ (n = 3) and unperfused (n = 3) control livers, respectively. The system consistently maintained livers in a moderately well functioning state through the first 4 hr of perfusion. Adequate support of animals with induced hepatic failure must now be demonstrated."

    "abstract": "Selected neurologic complications of pregnancy. Many neurologic disorders, such as eclampsia, pseudotumor cerebri, stroke, obstetric nerve palsies, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pituitary tumors, and choriocarcinoma, can develop in the pregnant patient. Maternal mortality from eclampsia, which ranges from 0 to 14%, can be due to intracerebral hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, disseminated intravascular coagulation, abruptio placentae, or failure of the liver or kidneys. Associated fetal mortality ranges from 10 to 28% and is directly related to decreased placental perfusion. Pseudotumor cerebri can be associated with serious visual complications; thus, the therapeutic goal is to prevent loss of vision. The risk of stroke in the pregnant patient is 13 times the risk in the nonpregnant patient of the same age. The major causes of stroke in pregnant patients are arterial occlusion and cerebral venous thrombosis. Lumbar disk prolapse is common in pregnant patients, and lumbosacral plexus injuries can occur during labor or delivery. In addition, peripheral nerve compression or entrapment syndromes are thought to be caused by the retention of fluid during pregnancy. The incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage during pregnancy is 1 in every 10,000 patients, a rate 5 times higher than in nonpregnant women. Because of a proliferation of prolactin-secreting cells, the pituitary gland can enlarge dramatically during pregnancy, a change that can disclose a previously unknown tumor or cause a known pituitary tumor to become symptomatic. The incidence of choriocarcinoma is 1 in 50,000 full-term pregnancies but 1 in 30 molar pregnancies. This malignant tumor has a high rate of cerebral metastatic lesions. In addition to these disorders that develop during pregnancy, the pregnant state can affect numerous preexisting neurologic conditions, including epilepsy, headaches, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, spinal cord injury, and brain tumors. We discuss advice for patients with such conditions who wish to become pregnant, recommendations for medical and surgical management, and surgical considerations for neurologic complications during pregnancy."

This report describes two cases of craniopharyngioma with perifocal edema. In both patients, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the tumors occupied the suprasellar cistern, invaginated the floor of the 3rd ventricle and were tightly adherent to the ventricular walls. The intraventricular portions of the tumors were cystic, containing protein-rich fluid as suggested by MRI and confirmed by operative findings. There was perifocal edema in the hypothalamus adjacent to the intraventricular tumor, the optic tracts, and the posterior limbs of the internal capsules, resembling the shape of a moustache on axial computed tomographic and MRI scans. The perifocal edema subsided after treatment of the intraventricular tumor by surgical resection or radiation therapy. The \"moustache\" appearance seems a unique, characteristic feature of perifocal edema, which is observed infrequently with certain craniopharyngiomas."

The course of a neonate administered activated charcoal orally for elevated phenobarbital concentration is described. The neonate required a serum concentration of phenobarbital eventually exceeding 80 micrograms/mL for seizure control. However, due to the severe CNS injury as a result of the asphyxia at birth, a diagnosis of cerebral death by electroencephalogram and apnea test was pursued. This required the phenobarbital concentration to be less than 30 micrograms/mL. Serial phenobarbital concentrations during this time indicated a 250 hour half-life, which would require two weeks for the phenobarbital to drop below 30 micrograms/mL. With the administration of six doses of activated charcoal at 0.7 g/kg/dose, the phenobarbital serum concentration decreased to 22 micrograms/mL, giving an estimated phenobarbital half-life of 22 hours. This, and two other subsequent cases, indicates repeated doses of activated charcoal are effective in augmenting the clearance of certain drugs in the neonatal age group."

In a series of 75 patients with surgically treated lipomyelomeningoceles, the neurological condition of six patients deteriorated 6 months to 14 years after the operation due to repeat tethering of the spinal cord. The tethering resulted from postoperative dense adhesion between the cord and the overlying dura mater. Two of the six patients underwent conventional repeat untethering procedures, and the remaining four were successfully treated with a new surgical technique developed by the authors to prevent such dural adhesion. For this procedure, after complete untethering of the spinal cord, the lumbosacral cord is retained in the center of the dural sac by fine stay sutures between the pia mater of the conus medullaris and the ventral dura mater. In addition, the dura mater is tacked to the posterior arch which is reconstructed with bone grafts at one or two bifid vertebral levels. During a postoperative follow-up period of 1 to 3 years, no further deterioration has been observed and magnetic resonance studies have demonstrated a space filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the lumbosacral cord. The authors conclude that long-term observation, both neurological and radiological, is essential even after successful repair of a lipomyelomeningocele. This new surgical procedure can maintain a CSF bath around the lumbosacral cord, thus preventing dural adhesion. Application of this technique will hopefully be beneficial in lipomyelomeningocele patients with a high risk of cord retethering after initial repair."

Fractures of the clival complex were diagnosed in a series of 17 patients admitted to the Maryland Institute for Emergency Medical Services System and the University of Maryland Medical System over a 30-month period. These fractures were divided pathologically into three types based upon their appearance on computed tomography: longitudinal, transverse, and oblique. The mechanisms of injury were similar in all groups, and the Glasgow Coma Scale scores at admission were comparable, regardless of fracture type, in survivors and nonsurvivors. Longitudinal fractures were associated with severe injury to the central nervous system and with brain stem infarction, and 4 of 6 (67%) of these patients died. Transverse fractures of the clival complex were found in 6 patients, 3 of whom (50%) died. All of these patients had fractures of the petrous ridge; 2 of the 3 survivors had multiple cranial nerve deficits, and one patient developed a carotid-cavernous fistula. Of the 5 patients with oblique clival fractures, 2 survived (40%), both of whom had multiple cranial nerve palsies; in addition, one of these patients developed a carotid-cavernous fistula. Using the present generation of computed tomographic scanners, fractures of the clival complex can be reliably diagnosed; they are probably more common than previously believed and can be separated into three groups based on the characteristics on computed tomographic scans and clinical findings."

The antinociceptive interaction on the tail flick (TF) and hot plate (HP) tests between opioid analgesics and medetomidine after intravenous (iv) or intrathecal administration were examined by isobolographic analysis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received fixed ratios of medetomidine to morphine, fentanyl, and meperidine of 1:10 and 1:30, 10:1, and 1:3, respectively, by iv administration or 10:1, 3:1 and 10:1, and 1:3 by intrathecal administration, respectively. Data were expressed as the percentage maximal possible effect (%MPE). The A50 (dose producing 50% MPE) for each drug or drug combination was determined from the dose-response curve. Isobolographic analysis revealed that the effect of medetomidine combined with fentanyl, morphine, or meperidine was additive after iv administration. The intrathecal administration of combinations of medetomidine with the opioids produced a synergistic antinociceptive effect in the TF but not HP test. These data confirmed that the interaction between medetomidine and opioids in producing antinociception may be additive or synergistic, depending on the route of administration, drug ratio administered, and level of processing of the nociceptive input (i.e., spinal vs. supraspinal). Moreover, these results were consistent with a spinal role for alpha-2 adrenoceptors in mediating antinociception. The authors suggest that the interaction between the opioid and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors occurs within the spinal cord."

The effects of a 2-night rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation (RSD) procedure on electroencephalographic sleep and mood were examined in 15 healthy elderly control subjects, 14 elderly patients with endogenous depression, and 15 patients with primary degenerative dementia. Compared with control subjects, both patient groups maintained a higher amount of REM sleep time and REM activity during RSD. Unexpectedly, depressed patients showed little rebound in visually scored or automated REM sleep measures following RSD, and they showed stability of REM activity temporal distribution from baseline to recovery conditions. This contrasted with the rebound in REM sleep activity seen in control subjects, and the more modest increase in demented patients. The RSD was fairly specific, with some impact on delta sleep during the procedure but not during recovery sleep. Mood ratings were unaffected by RSD. These findings demonstrated a greater plasticity of REM sleep regulation in the healthy elderly control subjects and suggested a higher REM \"pressure\" with a \"ceiling effect\" in depressed patients. Patients with dementia appeared to have an impaired capacity to respond to the challenge of RSD."

Since Crawford's report in 1973, repair of traumatic transection of the thoracic aorta without shunt or bypass has emerged as a popular technique which simplifies the operation and avoids use of heparin. Growing evidence, however, indicates that the incidence of paraplegia is higher with this method and may outweigh its advantages. With this in mind, we have examined our experience with 40 patients who underwent repair of aortic transection from 1975-1988. The operated patients in our series all survived. Fourteen were repaired using some type of bypass or shunt, none of whom developed paraplegia. The remaining 26 patients were repaired without a shunt and 9 (34.6%) developed paraplegia or paraparesis (p less than 0.02). Paraplegia was related to aortic occlusion time (p less than 0.002). It did not occur in 11 patients with times less than 27 minutes, but happened in 2 of 8 patients with times between 28 and 35 minutes and in all 7 patients with clamp times over 35 minutes. These data suggest that shunt or bypass should be used in most cases of aortic transection."

Children with prior afebrile seizures or evidence of acute central nervous system infection were excluded. Nine (20%) children had prior neurological deficits. The duration of the febrile seizure was 0.5 to 1 hour in 41 cases (85%), 1 to 2 hours in 5 (10%), and greater than 2 hours in 2 children (5%). No child died or developed new neurological deficits following the seizures. The risk of recurrent seizures was increased, but only in the group with prior neurological abnormality. Six (66%) of these children had subsequent febrile seizures compared with 12 (34%) of the normal children (P = .08). Three (33%) had recurrent febrile status epilepticus compared with only 1 (3%) normal child (P = .023). The 2 children in the prospective arm of the study with recurrent febrile status epilepticus were both neurologically abnormal (P = .035). All 3 of the children who subsequently had afebrile seizures (2 prospective) were neurologically abnormal (P = .006 overall, P = .035 for prospective only). It is concluded that the occurrence of febrile status epilepticus in a neurologically impaired child is a risk factor for subsequent febrile as well as afebrile seizures. The occurrence of febrile status epilepticus in an otherwise normal child does not significantly increase the risk for subsequent febrile (brief or prolonged) or afebrile seizures in the first few years following the episode."

Four spirochetal diseases frequently involve the central nervous system: syphilis, leptospirosis, relapsing fever, and Lyme borreliosis. In particular, syphilis and Lyme borreliosis are increasing problems. During the spirochetemic phase there is seeding of the nervous system. After a quiescent latent period, there may be late disease flareups producing a variety of neurologic syndromes. Cerebrospinal fluid examination is very helpful in these infections."

The course of idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus was studied in a 78-year-old woman with a 4-year history of progressive dementia who underwent neuropsychologic testing, quantitative x-ray computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18 to measure rates of regional cerebral glucose utilization. Preshunt cognitive testing demonstrated progressive deterioration during 2 years, and positron emission tomography showed significant reductions in regional cerebral glucose utilization of 34% to 49% as compared with age- and sex-matched control subjects in frontal, temporal, parietal, and whole brain regions. Periodic testing, carried out during a 2-year period after shunt surgery, showed steady improvement in clinical status. Parallel to the clinical changes, there was a significant reversal in neuropsychologic test scores with increased brain volume and increased regional cerebral glucose utilization in several brain regions. These results documented the considerable potential for recovery of compromised brain function in older subjects even after 4 years of progressive brain disease."

We elicited motor evoked potentials (MEPs) using transcortical magnetic stimulation in 150 control subjects aged 14 to 85 years and 275 patients with a variety of diseases. There were no significant side effects. Cortex-to-target muscle latencies measured 20.2 +/- 1.6 ms (thenar), 14.2 +/- 1.7 ms (extensor digitorum communis), 9.4 +/- 1.7 ms (biceps), and 27.2 +/- 2.9 ms (tibialis anterior). Central motor delay between the cortex and the C-7 and L-5 measured 6.7 +/- 1.2 ms and 13.1 +/- 3.8 ms, respectively. Mean spinal cord motor conduction velocity measured 65.4 m/s. MEP amplitude expressed as a percentage of the maximum M wave was never less than 20% of the M wave. A value of less than 10% is considered abnormal. MEP latency increases linearly with age and central motor delay is longer in older subjects. Compound muscle action potentials and absolute MEP amplitudes decreased linearly with age. In multiple sclerosis (MS), MEP latency and central delay were often very prolonged. The MEP was more sensitive than the SEP in MS. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, MEP latencies were only modestly prolonged; the characteristic abnormality was reduced amplitude. When pseudobulbar features predominated MEPs were often absent. The MEP was of normal latency in Parkinson's disease, but age-related amplitude was often increased. MEP latency and amplitude were normal in Huntington's disease. Abnormal MEPs persisted several months after stroke despite good functional recovery. The MEP could be used to advantage to demonstrate proximal conduction slowing and block in demyelinating neuropathies. In plexopathy, ability to elicit an MEP several days after onset of paresis was good evidence of neuronal continuity in motor fibers."

    "abstract": "Evidence for motor neuropathy and reduced filling of the rectum in chronic intractable constipation. Subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis is now frequently offered to patients with slow transit constipation who have severe symptoms and no response to more conventional medical treatment. If this operation is to be successful, the underlying problem should be delay in the progress of contents through the colon but no mechanical or functional obstruction in the small bowel or rectum. We have used a recently described technique of prolonged ambulant manometry and electromyography to investigate anorectal function in these patients. Pressure data were collected using a 2 mm diameter intrarectal probe carrying microtransducers, and external anal sphincter activity was assessed by a pair of silver-silver chloride surface electrodes. Fourteen control subjects and eight patients with colonic inertia were studied. Sampling reflexes, indicative of rectal filling, occurred at mean (SEM) rates of 7.4 (2.0)/hour in controls but were significantly reduced in patients (2.4 (0.3)/hour (p less than 0.01]. Recurrent rectal motor complexes were seen to occur in both groups at intervals of 76 (1.8) minutes in controls and 64.9 (7.2) minutes in patients (p less than 0.1), and with amplitudes of 42.4 (2.1) mmHg and 9.2 (0.7) mmHg (p less than 0.001), respectively. External sphincter electromyographic spike activity did not differ between groups. Our results support the concept of reduced transit of faeces to the rectum from the colon over a 24 hour period in slow transit constipation and suggest that a motor neuropathy may also be present in the rectum."

    "abstract": "Tuberculous meningitis. Tuberculous meningitis is an uncommon but potentially devastating form of tuberculosis. Current antituberculous drugs are highly effective when treatment is initiated early, before the onset of altered mentation or focal neurologic deficits. Because the clinical outcome depends greatly on the stage at which therapy is initiated, early recognition is of paramount importance. Patients with the meningoencephalitis syndrome and CSF findings of low glucose levels, elevated protein levels, and pleocytosis should be treated immediately if there is evidence of TB elsewhere in the body, or if prompt evaluation fails to establish an alternative diagnosis. Examination of CSF is the best diagnostic approach; with sufficient diligence, serial AFB smears and cultures will usually yield positive results, even days after therapy has been started. The CT scan is an important and highly effective tool for the diagnosis and management of patients with TBM. In a patient with compatible clinical features, the combination of basilar meningeal enhancement and any degree of hydrocephalus is strongly suggestive of the diagnosis of TBM. Serial evaluation by CT scanning is useful for following the course of hydrocephalus and tuberculoma, particularly in reference to the need for, or response to, adjunctive therapy with corticosteroids and surgery. The decision to administer corticosteroids should be based on careful correlation of the clinical and radiographic features of the case. Surgical shunting should be considered early in the patient with hydrocephalus and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. Tuberculomas are best treated medically, often in conjunction with corticosteroids where cerebral edema is believed to contribute to neurologic decline. The recommended chemotherapy regimen is isoniazid and rifampin in all patients, together with pyrazinamide for the first 2 months."

Retrograde transurethral balloon dilatation (RTBD) of the prostate recently has been suggested as alternative therapy for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Seven patients with documented functional urinary outlet obstruction at the level of the bladder neck or prostatic urethra underwent RTBD of prostate. Each patient had a classic diagnosis of abacterial chronic prostatitis or prostatodynia based on history, physical examination, and localization cultures. Prior to RTBD of prostate, patients underwent cystoscopy, voiding cystourethrogram, urodynamic and uroflow studies. RTBD of prostate was done as an outpatient procedure requiring intravenous sedation or general anesthesia. Dilation was performed with a 25-mm urethroplasty balloon catheter inflated at 3.5 atm of pressure for twenty minutes. Improvement in voiding symptomatology was noted in all patients and graded numerically (0-10 scale), with ten indicating normal voiding. Follow-up to date ranges from one to five months. This technique may have promise as a treatment option in patients with abacterial chronic prostatitis and prostatodynia."

Repeated episodes of headache and muscle cramp were hypothesized to contribute to increased patient perceptions of illness intrusiveness and to compromised quality of life. Standard measures of pain, illness intrusiveness, and quality of life were obtained on 2 occasions, each 6 weeks apart, from 100 end-stage renal disease patients. The impact of recurrent muscle cramps on perceptions of illness intrusiveness was conditional upon the occurrence of headache symptoms. Perceptions of illness intrusiveness were significantly higher when both muscle cramp and headache symptoms occurred during one or more assessment intervals as compared to when muscle cramps or headaches, only, occurred. Illness-related concerns and general feelings of pessimism were also significantly higher among patients who experienced recurrent episodes of muscle cramp. Although no direct relations were observed between pain and other quality of life indicators, previous research has documented a relation between illness intrusiveness and quality of life. Recurrent pain problems, thus, appear to contribute to increased illness intrusiveness and to reduced quality of life in end-stage renal disease patients."

California Collaborative Treatment Group. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. In patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), the rate of relapse after primary treatment for cryptococcal meningitis remains high. We conducted a controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate the efficacy of maintenance therapy with fluconazole. At entry into the study, all participants had sterile cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine after following a standardized course of therapy for culture-proved cryptococcal meningitis. The patients were randomly assigned to take either fluconazole or placebo as maintenance therapy. The dose of fluconazole was 100 mg daily in the first phase of study and 200 mg daily in the second phase. RESULTS. Of 84 patients initially enrolled, 16 (19 percent) were found to have silent, persistent infection on the basis of cultures that became positive after entry into the study; 7 other patients were lost to follow-up shortly after entry. Of the remaining 61 patients, 10 of 27 assigned to placebo (37 percent) and 1 of 34 assigned to fluconazole (3 percent) had a recurrence of cryptococcal infection at any site (difference in risk, 34 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 15 to 53). Of the 11 recurrent infections, 7 were detected in urine obtained after prostatic massage. There were four recurrent meningeal infections in the patients taking placebo, but none in those taking fluconazole (mean duration of follow-up, 164 days) (P = 0.03). In multivariate analyses, the best predictors of recurrence-free survival were fluconazole treatment (P = 0.02; relative hazard, 13.2), a lower serum cryptococcal-antigen titer (P = 0.05; relative hazard, 1.2), and more prolonged primary therapy with flucytosine (P = 0.09; relative hazard, 1.1). Survival and toxicity were similar in the two maintenance-treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS. In patients with AIDS, silent persistent infection is common after clinically successful treatment for cryptococcal meningitis. Maintenance therapy with fluconazole is highly effective in preventing recurrent cryptococcal infection."

Risks are provided for various prior population risks, for various levels of elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, and for various assumptions about the sensitivity of ultrasonographic examination. The formula used is based on sequential multiplication of odds with the use of Bayes' theorem, but an arbitrary reduction (to the power of 0.5) in the degree to which ultrasonographic information modifies the odds has been made to allow for the nonindependence of ultrasonography and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein tests.

Six isolated spinal lesions presented more insidiously and morbidity was related to incomplete resection. Twelve (23%) of the patients definitely had von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHLD). The true proportion may be higher as this diagnosis was not definitely excluded in many of the remainder; only ten patients with seemingly isolated cerebellar tumours were appropriately investigated and two had evidence of VHLD. Four out of 26 cases (15%) with apparently completely resected, isolated, cerebellar lesions later developed recurrent tumours. Brainstem and supratentorial haemangioblastomas were rare and were always associated with VHLD. The cerebellar or spinal haemangioblastomas due to VHLD had no distinctive clinical features compared with isolated tumours and there was considerable overlap in age of onset between the two groups of cases. All patients with an apparently isolated CNS haemangioblastoma should be investigated for evidence of von Hippel-Lindau disease."

The cerebral effects of sevoflurane were compared in dogs with those of enflurane and isoflurane. Initially, the minimum alveolar concentrations (MAC) of sevoflurane and enflurane were determined and the electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to increasing doses of sevoflurane (1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 MAC) or enflurane (1.5 and 2.0 MAC) in unparalysed animals were examined. Administration of sevoflurane was not associated with seizure activity at any concentration either during normocapnia (PaCO2 5.3 kPa) or hypocapnia (PaCO2 2.7 kPa), even in the presence of intense auditory stimuli. All dogs anaesthetized with enflurane demonstrated sustained EEG and motor evidence of seizure activity induced by auditory stimuli at concentrations of enflurane greater than 1 MAC, particularly during hypocapnia. In a separate group of dogs, the effects of increasing concentrations of sevoflurane and isoflurane (0.5, 1.5 and 2.15 MAC) were compared directly on arterial pressure, cardiac output and heart rate, cerebral blood flow and the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2) using the venous outflow technique. Sevoflurane, in common with isoflurane, had minimal effects on cerebral blood flow at the concentrations studied, but significantly reduced the CMRO2 at end-tidal concentrations sufficient to produce a burst suppression pattern on the EEG (approximately 2.15 MAC). Both sevoflurane and isoflurane significantly decreased arterial pressure in a dose-dependent manner, but neither drug significantly altered cardiac output."

Cerebrospinal fluid samples were obtained at lumbar puncture from 53 patients with a wide variety of neurological disorders. Cerebrospinal fluid samples were tested for the presence of P2 protein, a constituent of myelin, with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay technique using a specific polyclonal antibody. High concentrations of P2 in the cerebrospinal fluid paralleled a raised IgG index (clearance ratio), the presence of oligoclonal bands, as well as raised white cell counts or depressed albumin:IgG ratios. Twenty one patients had been diagnosed as having definite or probable multiple sclerosis and the remaining 32 had other conditions. Of the 13 patients with high positive P2, 12 (92%) were in the multiple sclerosis category; of the 40 patients with low (12) or undetectable (28) P2 concentrations, only nine (23%) were diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis. In this patient population the presence of high immunoreactive P2 concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid was closely associated with evidence of intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis and with the clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. On this basis it is suggested that immunoassay of P2 concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid may be of potential value in the investigation of patients with demyelinating disorders."

EMLA cream (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics) is a new topical anesthetic composed of 25 mg lidocaine and 25 mg prilocaine in an oil-in-water emulsion cream. It has been found to be very effective for local anesthesia prior to venepuncture, minor surgical procedures, and pulsed dye laser (PDL) therapy for port-wine stains (PWS) in children. However, since EMLA may cause vasoconstriction of cutaneous vessels, we tried to determine whether pretreatment with EMLA decreases the efficacy of subsequent PDL treatment. We report eight patients between the ages of 4 and 32 years with PWS who received two test site treatments prior to PDL treatment. One site was pretreated with EMLA cream under occlusion for 60 minutes and then left unoccluded for 15 minutes prior to PDL test treatment. The other site, in the same area of the PWS and patient's body, was not pretreated with EMLA. The test sites were compared 6-8 weeks later to determine whether EMLA decreased the degree of lightening of the PWS compared to the non-EMLA-treated site. We conclude that EMLA is an effective topical anesthetic for PDL treatment of PWS and does not adversely affect the efficacy of the treatment."

The protein coding sequence of several beta-hexosaminidase alpha-chain complementary DNAs isolated by polymerase chain reaction was completely normal except for a G-to-A transition at nucleotide position 1511 within exon 13, which resulted in substitution of the normal arginine 504 (CGC) with histidine (CAC). Although the patient was from a first-cousin marriage, she was heterozygous for this mutation. The abnormality in the other allele, which is carried by the father, was not identified, except that it is neither of the two mutations responsible for the infantile Jewish Tay-Sachs disease.

Methylmalonic aciduria can be caused by mutations in the gene encoding the methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase apoenzyme (mut) or genes required for the provision of cofactor B12 (cbl). The mut and cbl forms are classically differentiated by somatic cell complementation. We describe a novel method for differential diagnosis of mut and cbl methylmalonic aciduria using DNA-mediated gene transfer of a methylmalonyl CoA mutase cDNA clone. Gene transfer of a functional methylmalonyl CoA mutase cDNA clone into mut fibroblasts reconstitutes holoenzyme activity measured by metabolism of [14C]-propionate in culture. Identical gene transfers into cbl fibroblasts have no effect. This method is used for the differential diagnosis of mut and cbl genotypes in cells from patients with a clinical diagnosis of methylmalonic aciduria and is shown to be a facile, sensitive, and specific method for genetic diagnosis. This work establishes the principle of using DNA-mediated gene transfer to identify the genotype of diseases which can result from mutations at several different genetic loci. This type of differential genotypic diagnosis will be particularly important for establishing the applicability of somatic gene therapy in individual patients."

The purpose of this study was to examine effects of antihypertensive treatment on structure and mechanics of cerebral arterioles and the incidence of stroke in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Treatment of hypertension was begun at 3 months of age with cilazapril (45 mg/kg/day), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, or with hydralazine (18 mg/kg/day). Cilazapril and hydralazine reduced systolic arterial pressure (from 195 +/- 8 to 125 +/- 5 and 148 +/- 3 mm Hg, respectively [mean +/- SEM]; p less than 0.05). To examine structure and mechanics of cerebral arterioles, we measured pressure (servonull), external diameter, and cross-sectional area of the vessel wall (histologically) in pial arterioles of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats and SHRSP that were untreated or that were treated for 3 months with cilazapril or with hydralazine. Arterioles were maximally dilated with EDTA. In WKY rats, cilazapril and hydralazine did not alter pial arteriolar pressure, external diameter, or cross-sectional area of the vessel wall. In SHRSP, both cilazapril and hydralazine reduced cross-sectional area of the vessel wall to levels not significantly different from WKY rats (from 1,911 +/- 155 to 1,244 +/- 101 and 1,388 +/- 59 microns 2, respectively, compared with 1,405 +/- 95 microns 2 for untreated WKY rats).

Cilazapril, but not hydralazine, attenuated reductions in external diameter of pial arterioles (from 91 +/- 4 to 100 +/- 4 microns for cilazapril versus 91 +/- 3 microns for hydralazine compared with 107 +/- 3 microns for untreated WKY rats)."

Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) injected into the cerebral ventricles of small mammals induces EEG limbic seizures, behavioral excitability, stereotyped behavior, and tardive enhancement of hippocampal theta voltage and frequency. Because we addressed this phenomenon when we explained the pathogenesis of infantile spasms in children, we wished to study the interference exerted by some gamma-endorphin fragments on EEG epileptiform and behavioral symptoms induced by CRF in the rabbit. Animals were implanted intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) with semichronic cortical and hippocampal electrodes, together with a cannula into the left lateral ventricle. When some gamma-endorphin derivatives (DT gamma E, DE gamma E) were injected intravenously (i.v.) for 4 days (or hydrocortisone once), they prevented the EEG ictal seizures induced in the hippocampus of rabbits by CRF injected i.c.v. Hydrocortisone and DE gamma E also prevented the appearance of scattered spiking and partially prevented tardive enhancement of theta voltage in the hippocampal EEG. Finally, DE gamma E also prevented stereotyped behavior and excitability induced by CRF. These results confirm the regulatory role exerted by CRF in limbic structure excitability and suggest that the above peptides may be involved in a regulatory feedback mechanism of CRF metabolism or activity. The possibility that these peptides may also have interesting antiepileptogenic properties should be considered."

Similar to cerebellar senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease, many kuru plaques contained ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative small granular elements, presumably representing dystrophic neurites. Our results suggest that similar mechanisms are involved in neuritic changes in cerebellar plaques in Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Alzheimer's diseases despite differences of amyloid proteins in the plaques."

    "abstract": "Extrapyramidal features in advanced Down's syndrome: clinical evaluation and family history. Extrapyramidal, frontal release, and other neurological signs were studied in 54 demented and non-demented patients with Down's syndrome (DS). Fourteen patients were demented and five showed extrapyramidal signs, mainly of the rigid-hypokinetic spectrum and similar to Parkinsonian features in advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD). None of the non-demented patients had Parkinsonian signs. The mean age of the demented DS patients with extrapyramidal signs was significantly higher than that of the patients without. Frontal release signs were present in demented and non-demented patients. A questionnaire showed no increase in either the proportion of early- or senile-onset dementia or Parkinsonism among first- and second-degree relatives of DS patients. Parkinsonian signs appear to be present at a lower frequency in DS than in advanced AD. A speculative hypothesis about a gene dosage effect of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase in preventing toxic radical formation in the substantia nigra of DS patients is presented."

    "abstract": "Mutation of the prion protein in Libyan Jews with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. BACKGROUND. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a transmissible neurodegenerative disorder that occurs more than 100 times more frequently among Libyan Jews than in the worldwide population. We examined 11 patients with the disease--10 Libyan Jews from Israel and 1 Libyan Jew from Italy--to determine whether abnormalities of the prion protein could be detected in them. Abnormal forms of this host-encoded protein are the predominant if not sole components of the transmissible agent that causes the disease. METHODS. The prion-protein open-reading frame in peripheral-leukocyte DNA from the Italian patient was amplified with the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to assess a prion-protein codon 200 lysine mutation in the 10 Israeli patients and 37 control subjects. RESULTS. The prion-protein sequence in DNA from the Italian patient revealed a single nucleotide change (G----A) at the first position of codon 200 that resulted in a substitution of lysine for glutamate. This substitution was detected in all 10 Israeli patients, 8 of whom had a positive family history of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. One patient was homozygous for the lysine mutation, and her clinical course did not differ from that of the patients heterozygous for the mutation. The lysine mutation was not found in one Moroccan Jew from Israel with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. CONCLUSIONS. The codon 200 lysine mutation of the prion-protein gene is consistently present among Libyan Jews with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, strongly supporting a genetic pathogenesis of their illness. The similarity of the clinical courses of the patient homozygous for this mutation and the patients heterozygous for it argues that familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a true dominant disorder."

    "abstract": "Basic mechanisms in vascular headache. To better understand and treat painful conditions, one needs to identify the cause, discover the source, and develop knowledge of peripheral and central pain transmission; headaches are no exception. The development of appropriate animal models is important. Accordingly, we have reviewed the anatomy, neurochemistry, electrophysiology, and pharmacology of the trigeminovascular system in experimental animals and emphasized whenever possible the relevance of this final common pathway to migraine, cluster, and other headache syndromes in humans. For example, based on recent anatomic dissections, the pericarotid cavernous sinus plexus was suggested as an important focus to investigate cluster headache pathophysiology. This plexus is an anatomic point of convergence for the nerves giving rise to the signs of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity and sensory symptoms that develop in cluster patients. As in other nociceptive systems, trigeminovascular axons assume at least two important roles. One concerns the transmission of nociceptive information. Electrophysiologic evidence supports the trigeminal nucleus caudalis as an important site for the convergence of visceral (vessel) and somatic (forehead) inputs to mediate the referral of vascular pain to superficial tissues. A second important role concerns the initiation of local increases in blood flow and enhanced protein permeability (sterile inflammation) via the axonal release of vasoactive neuropeptides. Plasma extravasation develops within the dura mater following trigeminal stimulation. Extravasation can be blocked by the administration of ergot alkaloids or sumatriptan, a new serotonin-like agonist, and a prejunctional (neuronal) mechanism of action for these drugs (such as blockade of release) was suggested based on experimental evidence. Whether vasoconstriction also relates to the therapeutic efficacy remains to be determined. As in other organ systems, real or threatened tissue injury provides an important stimulus for depolarizing sensory fibers. The stimulus may come from external conditions such as reduced blood flow or hypoglycemia. The brain may also possess intrinsic neuronal mechanisms by which nociceptors may be synthesized (e.g., glutamate-induced neurotoxicity, seizures). Molecules of relevance include bradykinin, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and potassium. Experimental evidence was presented demonstrating that the trigeminal nerve mediates hyperemia within cortical gray matter by axon-reflex like mechanisms. An important role for this nerve was established during the hyperemic period of recirculation after ischemia or during severe hypertension above the limits of autoregulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)."

Six patients with AIDS and AIDS related complex (ARC) who developed neuromuscular symptoms associated with vesicular changes in muscle fibres are reported. Two patients in the advanced stages of AIDS, who did not receive zidovudine, developed proximal limb weakness and wasting: both had a necrotising myopathy with an unusual segmental vesicular change of myofibres. There were numerous vesicles 0.1 to 2 microns in diameter produced by dilatations of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in fibres depleted of myofibrils. Four patients developed a myopathy while receiving zidovudine for AIDS. One of these had an inflammatory myopathy which showed the development of vesicular change due to enlargement and electron lucency of mitochondria. The three other patients with ARC developed muscle pains or weakness and elevated serum CK while on zidovudine. These patients also showed vesicular changes due to enlargement and electron lucency of mitochondria associated with disruption of sarcomeres and the presence of cytoplasmic bodies. The muscular symptoms resolved when ziduvodine was stopped and repeat biopsy in one case revealed no abnormalities."

Extrapyramidal signs, particularly rigidity and tremor, have been reported in a proportion of patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type. To test the hypothesis that these extrapyramidal signs are similar clinically and neurochemically to the extrapyramidal signs of Parkinson's disease, a group of 20 patients satisfying clinical criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease were studied and assessed clinically for the presence of rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia. In those patients with extrapyramidal signs, qualitative differences were observed between the signs in these patients and in subjects with Parkinson's disease. Fifteen of 20 patients underwent fluoro-18-dopa scans, which showed no significant difference in fluoro-18-dopa uptake into the caudate and putamen between normal subjects and the rigid and nonrigid patients with Alzheimer's disease, in contrast to the marked reduction in fluoro-18-dopa uptake into the putamen that is observed in Parkinson's disease. This provides clinical and in vivo neurochemical support for the hypothesis that extranigral factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of rigidity in Alzheimer's disease."

In the first two weeks after injury, in females and in males, there was no significant difference in mean hemoglobin level between SI and SCI patients. At six weeks, no male with SI was anemic, and males with SCI had significantly lower mean hemoglobin levels than those with SI (121.6 g/L vs 145.4 g/L, p less than .001). Identified early causes of anemia were blood loss due to bony soft tissue or visceral injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, and surgery. In the postacute phase (more than six weeks after injury), anemia occurred in 25 of 41 male and three of nine female SCI patients, and its occurrence was associated with the presence of an identified chronic disease, especially urinary tract infection."

Psychological factors include all those pain-associated alterations in the patient's environment that reinforce illness behavior. Psychiatric illness includes those syndromes that retard recovery from illness or injury, such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and dementia. Psychiatric and psychological interventions can be successfully introduced in the context of a comprehensive rehabilitation effort.

Although calcium antagonists were originally developed for use in the management of patients with angina pectoris, they are now used in the management of other cardiovascular disorders, including hypertension. More recently, the calcium antagonists have been under investigation for their potential protective role in atherosclerosis. Coupled with these new possibilities for therapeutic use are the development of new, long-acting, tissue-specific calcium antagonists. Amlodipine belongs to this group, and although it is a dihydropyridine-based calcium antagonist, its pharmacologic profile differs from that of other dihydropyridine-based calcium antagonists. Differences include: different pH optimum for receptor binding, different rates of association and dissociation, and differences in allosteric interaction with the diltiazem and verapamil binding sites. Amlodipine, when given orally to rabbits receiving a high-cholesterol diet, reduces atheroma formation. Evidence of its ability to protect the vasculature is provided by its ability to significantly increase (p less than 0.001) survival in stroke-prone hypertensive rats."

To study the effect of age on seizure latency, intensity, reproducibility, and mortality in genetically epilepsy-prone rats of the severe colony (GEPR-9s), 472 seizure-naive rats, ranging in age from 14 to 65 days, received a series of three audiogenic stimulations. Both the percentage of rats having one or more seizures and the percentage of seizures that were stage 9 generally increased with advancing age of the animal at the time of the first stimulation. Mean latency to seizure onset decreased while seizure intensity increased with increasing age of the animal. Reproducibility of seizure stage also increased with advancing age of the animal. The effects of senescence on seizure susceptibility were also investigated in an additional 18 prepubescent rats (25-35 days) who received three audiogenic stimulations and were tested again between the ages of 480 and 540 days with identical testing procedures. No significant changes occurred with either latency to seizure onset or seizure intensity in rats tested during prepubescence and again at senescence. Although GEPR-9s provide an excellent model of inherited seizures, latency to seizure onset, seizure intensity, and seizure reproducibility is dependent on age of the animal. Once established, however, audiogenic-induced seizures persist throughout life."

    "abstract": "Experimental nerve root compression. A model of acute, graded compression of the porcine cauda equina and an analysis of neural and vascular anatomy. Nerve root compression has been suggested as one important pathogenetic factor in low-back pain syndromes and sciatica. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are, however, incompletely known, partly because of the lack of experimental data on this topic. In the present study, a model for experimental compression of the porcine sacrococcygeal cauda equina is presented. The model consists of surgical exposure of the cauda equina and compression of the cauda equina toward the ventral aspect of the spinal canal by an inflatable balloon fixed to the spine. This compression system was shown to have a high accuracy in pressure transmission from the balloon to the cauda equina. The gross and microscopic neural anatomy and the vascular anatomy of the porcine cauda equina were analyzed with light microscopic and ink-perfusion techniques. The porcine cauda equina showed a close anatomic resemblance to the human lumbosacral cauda equina. The presented model offers unique possibilities for experimental studies on nerve root compression injury because of the easy surgical exposure and the sufficient length of the nerve roots. In separate studies, this model, along with investigations of solute transport to the nerve tissue and of impulse propagation, has been used to analyze the effects of acute, graded compression on blood flow and edema formation in the cauda equina. The porcine cauda equina would also be particularly suitable for chronic compression studies because any neurologic deficit acquired would be restricted to the tail."

Due to the risk of posttraumatic epilepsy, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproic acid are often prescribed for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this review the literature is examined for evidence of neurobehavioral impairment due to carbamazepine, phenytoin, and valproic acid. No comparative studies have been performed in the TBI population, making if difficult to determine if one of these medications is preferable. Direct inference from studies on epilepsy patients to TBI patients is hazardous due to underlying differences in the two populations. Reported findings for epilepsy patients are subtle and not consistent across studies. All three drugs appear to exert some effect on cognitive and motor functions in epileptic patients, and these impairments worsen at increasing serum levels. The varied length of experience with each drug makes it difficult to assign relative weight to the evidence for or against each. A comparative assessment of cognitive and behavioral effects of anticonvulsants should be done in the TBI population."

The magnetic resonance longitudinal relaxation time (T1) and transverse relaxation time (T2) of the water proton of the periventricular white and cortical gray matter were measured for 17 control patients and 21 patients with suspected normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Of the latter group, 14 showed good response to shunting (true-NPH group) and seven showed no response (false-NPH group). In the true-NPH group, both the T1 and the T2 of the periventricular white matter were significantly prolonged compared to the control values, and slowly shortened after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting. The true-NPH group showed significantly longer T1 and T2 of the white matter than did the false-NPH group. The T1 and T2 of the white matter were longer than those of the gray matter in this group, which was the reverse of the relationship observed in the control patients. In the white matter of the false-NPH group, there was a significant prolongation of T1 only; no difference was seen in the T2 compared to control values. There was no change in either T1 or T2 of this region after CSF shunting. The false-NPH group showed no significant difference in either T1 or T2 between the white and the gray matter. There was no difference in either T1 or T2 of the gray matter between the false-NPH and control groups or between preshunt and postshunt measurements in each patient group. It is suggested that a distinction between true- and false-NPH, which cannot be made from the radiographic appearance alone, may be possible from measurement of relaxation times. The mechanism of varied relaxation behavior between two entities may be explained by a difference in properties of the biological water and its environment."

Frequently instability and premature onset of spondylosis of the cervical spine are found in athetoid cerebral palsy (CP) patients. These structural abnormalities appear to be related to athetoid motion of the neck in CP. Through motion analysis, the authors aimed to clarify the abnormalities of cervical motion that could precipitate structural abnormalities. The gross characteristic feature of cervical motion in athetoid CP is \"whip movement.\" Both velocity and acceleration during extension-flexion motion were greater than in normal subjects, especially at the upper cervical levels. Also, a sudden increase in velocity and acceleration occurred during rapid motions at certain levels, followed by a larger range of motion of the cervical spine. Such kinematic abnormalities were thought to generate a greater shearing force and bending moment exerted on the corresponding cervical articulations-discs and facets. Olisthetic instability often accompanied disc degeneration at the upper cervical levels. A large range of extension--flexion motion of the cervical spine, analogous to a cantilever, caused a repeated bending moment of extraordinary magnitude and was regarded as a precipitative factor for disc degeneration and osteophytosis common at the middle and lower levels of the disc."

Previous studies have demonstrated that, with the exception of atracurium, resistance to the neuromuscular blocking effects of various muscle relaxants develops in patients receiving anticonvulsant therapy.

The evoked compound electromyogram of the adductor pollicis brevis was recorded, and results were analyzed using analysis of covariance, with weight and age as covariables. The onset time was not significantly different among the three groups. Times for recovery of baseline and train-of-four responses to stimuli were significantly shorter in the MED = 1 and MED = 2 groups than in control patients (MED = 0). The recovery index (time between 25% and 75% recovery of baseline electromyogram values) was progressively shorter in the three groups (MED = 0: 8.02 min; MED = 1: 5.93 min; MED = 2: 1.96 min; P less than 0.001). This study demonstrates that atracurium, when used on epileptic patients requiring long-term (that is, years of) anticonvulsant therapy, has a shorter duration of action than when used in nonepileptic patients."

Proton magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been recommended as a diagnostic tool for the detection of focal cerebral ischemia. We compared microscopic MR images of rat brains after focal cerebral ischemia with evidence of histological damage found on corresponding silver-impregnated or cresyl violet-stained brain sections. Ten male Wistar rats were subjected to permanent unilateral occlusions of the right middle cerebral and common carotid arteries under halothane anesthesia. Twenty-four hours later the area of injury on MR images amounted to 26% of the total slice area, whereas only 9% of the total slice area was necrotic on histological sections from the same animals. The infarcted areas on tissue sections were surrounded by regions of selective neuronal injury in the cerebral cortex and occasionally in the hippocampus. The area of injury on MR images was larger than the combined areas of infarction and selective neuronal injury on histological sections. Areas of increased T2 values on MR images extended medially into noninfarcted striatum and laterally and dorsally into noninfarcted cortex. The lateral and dorsal areas on MR images frequently coincided with cortical areas in which considerable selective neuronal injury was present in the upper cortical layers. We hypothesize that the abnormal areas on MR images above histologically normal brain tissue represent the ischemic penumbra. If true, this is the first demonstration of the ischemic penumbra by MR imaging and may reflect our use of Wistar rats, a new image analysis technique, and ultra-high resolution MR imaging."

Each patient had 6 measurements of cerebral blood flow by positron tomography with 2 scans at rest, 2 during movement of fingers of the recovered hand, and 2 during movement of fingers of the normal hand. When the normal fingers were moved, regional cerebral blood flow increased significantly in contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex and in the ipsilateral cerebellar hemisphere.

Other regions, namely, insula, inferior parietal, and premotor cortex, were also bilaterally activated with movement of the recovered hand. We have also demonstrated, by using a new technique of image analysis, different functional connections between the thalamic nuclei and specific cortical and cerebellar regions during these movements.

Serum and CSF levels were significantly and specifically higher in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia than in other subjects (serum, p less than 0.001; CSF, p less than 0.05). Serum levels of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin were significantly elevated in the early stage of Alzheimer-type dementia, whereas there was no definite correlation between serum levels and the degree of dementia. CSF levels of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin tended to parallel the severity of dementia. Serum levels were not correlated with CSF levels.

Our findings suggest that caregiver-related problems can have a collective effect on rehabilitation outcome and that treatment should reduce caregiver depression, minimize family dysfunction, and increase the family's knowledge about stroke care."

    "abstract": "Multidisciplinary baseline assessment of homosexual men with and without human immunodeficiency virus infection. III. Neurologic and neuropsychological findings. We explored the possibility that neurologic and neuropsychological changes constitute the earliest detectable manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Without knowledge of HIV status, we assessed neurologic signs and symptoms and administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to 208 homosexual men, of whom 84 were HIV negative, 49 were HIV positive and asymptomatic, 29 were mildly symptomatic, and 46 had significant medical symptoms but not the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. There was no difference between the HIV-negative and HIV-positive men in the frequency of neurologic signs or of defective or borderline performance on any neuropsychological test. However, HIV-positive men performed slightly but significantly worse than HIV-negative men on tests of verbal memory, executive function, and language. Similar results were obtained when comparisons were limited to HIV-positive medically asymptomatic and HIV-negative men. There was no degradation of neurologic status or neuropsychological performance across stages of HIV severity, but neurologic and neuropsychological summary scores correlated with CD4/CD8 ratios in the HIV-positive group. Ratings of neurologic signs and symptoms correlated with neuropsychological summary scores in the HIV-positive group only. Cognitive complaints were more frequent in the HIV-positive men; they correlated with actual test performance in the HIV-positive but not HIV-negative men. The constellation of subjective and objective neuropsychological and neurologic findings suggests the possibility of a definable syndrome associated with HIV infection in asymptomatic individuals."

    "abstract": "Meningitis in the neurosurgical patient. In the patient with a basilar skull fracture and CSF leak, the risk of meningitis is greatly increased. The diagnosis of both leak and infection can be obscured by the patient's other injuries, and requires aggressive investigation of symptoms that suggest infection. Although the diagnosis is made with CSF cultures, when clinically suspected, treatment should begin after appropriate cultures have been obtained. Treatment should be directed against the most likely organisms, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and the other organisms common to the upper respiratory tract. There are no good indications for prophylactic antibiotic usage in patients with known CSF leaks. The patient with a shunt or other CNS prosthetic device may have various manifestations of infection, depending on the type of device and its termination. Frank meningitis or ventriculitis is not always present. Diagnosis requires direct culturing of the shunt milieu, with the most frequent isolates being staphylococcal species and gram-negative enteric bacilli. The most effective therapy, for both eradication of the infection and minimization of the duration and morbidity of therapy, involves removal of the infected shunt, external drainage during parenteral antibiotic therapy, and complete replacement of hardware at the time of internalization. The postsurgical patient will not develop meningitis very frequently, but like the posttrauma patient, concurrent factors can make the diagnosis difficult. Differentiating infectious from chemical meningitis must often be initially based on CSF cell counts and chemistries alone. Treatment to cover the most likely organism, staphylococcal species and respiratory flora, should be started before the culture results are finalized."

The relapsing course, association with myoclonus or tremulousness, and episodes of stroke-like deterioration are characteristic features. The long-term prognosis is favorable with steroid therapy, though additional immunosuppressive therapy may be required. Neurologic investigation typically shows a diffusely abnormal EEG, high CSF protein level without pleocytosis, and normal brain CT and cerebral angiogram.

In group 1, anti-neuronal nuclear antibodies were detected in eight patients (38%), in titres from 1:1000 to 1:32,000. A small cell lung cancer was present in six patients, ovarian cancer in one patient and in one patient no tumour could be detected. The neurological symptoms preceded a diagnosis of cancer in five out of eight patients. Anti-neuronal antibodies were found in the serum of two out of 94 patients (2%) from control group 3 but not in serum from any of the other control groups.

Four cases of idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy were documented after 110 consecutive resections of the temporal lobe for intractable epilepsy. In 3 of the 4 cases, the palsy was ipsilateral to the side of the temporal lobectomy. The onset of facial weakness was delayed 7 to 13 days after surgery (mean, 9.7 days). One patient underwent facial electroneurography, which documented 17% of normal facial motor function at the height of his weakness and the absence of the acoustic stapedius reflex. All patients were treated with prednisone (60-80 mg per day by mouth for 10-14 days, tapering off throughout the subsequent week). Facial function recovered fully in all patients within 6 to 8 weeks. Possible mechanisms are discussed, including heat and/or mechanical trauma to the facial nerve near the geniculate ganglion during resection of mesial temporal lobe structures."

    "abstract": "Dual task performance and processing resources in normal subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. In recent years, there has been a growing consensus among investigators that the presence or absence of external cues guiding behaviour and attention is an important factor in determining whether or not deficits are found in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In an earlier study, the authors suggested that the pattern of impaired and intact performance could be explained in terms of differential resource demands of the tasks, combined with depleted levels of central processing resources in PD patients. Two experiments are reported, both employing dual-task paradigms. The first assessed, in normal subjects, the relative processing demands of a cued and an uncued version of the Stroop task. The results supported the proposal that the noncued task made greater demands on the subject's limited processing resources. Further, performing a resource demanding secondary task concurrently with the Stroop test produced, in normal subjects, the same pattern of impaired performance as that reported previously in PD patients. In the second experiment the same dual-task paradigm was employed with a group of PD patients and normal aged-matched controls. Only the patients showed an increase in reaction time on the Stroop task when performing a resource demanding secondary task. The patients also showed an interfering effect with concurrent foot tapping but not with an articulatory suppression task. The results were taken to support the hypothesis that PD patients have depleted central processing resources. In considering the present data, alternative explanations for the results are considered, in particular the possibility that they represent a deficit in switching processing resources between two tasks as the combined demands outweigh available resources."

We describe 14 patients with glutaric aciduria type 1 in five Canadian Indian kindreds living in Manitoba and northwest Ontario. The patients had marked clinical variability of the disease, even within families. Eight followed the typical clinical course of normal early growth and development until the onset of neurologic abnormalities, often precipitated by infection, between 6 weeks and 7 1/2 months of age. Five patients had early developmental delay; one was thought to be normal until 8 years of age. Three patients died, seven are severely mentally and physically handicapped, and four have only mild mental retardation or incoordination. Six patients had macrocephaly in the neonatal period. Computed tomography was done for 12 patients, and findings were abnormal in 11. Glutaric acid and 3-hydroxyglutaric acid were detected in increased amounts in the urine of all patients, but the concentrations were much lower than those in most other reported patients. Glutaryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase activity in skin fibroblasts, interleukin-2-dependent lymphocytes, or both, ranged from 0% to 13% of control values. There was no correlation between clinical severity and urine glutaric acid concentration or level of residual enzyme activity. We recommend that organic acid analysis of the urine be done in patients with unexplained cerebral palsy-like disorders, especially if the computed tomographic scan is abnormal. If there is suspicion of glutaric aciduria, glutaryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase should be measured in fibroblasts or lymphocytes even if glutaric acid is not increased in the urine."

A patient (B.J.) is reported who developed severe memory impairment following a penetrating brain injury caused by a snooker cue which entered through his left nostril into the basal regions of the brain. Initially, his memory disorder had the clinical features of a dense amnesic syndrome, with both anterograde and retrograde amnesia, but B.J. subsequently showed significant recovery of memory function. Formal memory testing was carried out 21 months after injury. This demonstrated marked verbal memory impairment, as severe as that seen in patients with the amnesic syndrome. On nonverbal memory tests, his impairment was relatively mild and patchy. His retrograde amnesia had regressed mainly to affect a 6 month period before the injury. On other cognitive tasks, he performed at an average or above average level, and there was no neuropsychological evidence of frontal lobe dysfunction. Neuroradiological investigations at various stages after his injury failed to demonstrate a lesion in any of the thalamic nuclei. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a lesion in the hypothalamus in the region of the mamillary bodies. Our study demonstrates that marked, relatively focal, memory disorder after diencephalic injury can occur without direct pathology to the body of the thalamus. It also indicates that structures in or adjacent to the hypothalamus, such as the mamillary bodies, may play a more important role in human memory functioning than has hitherto been considered."

The areas of six bilateral brain segments in the right and left hemispheres, on a horizontal brain section, and the area of subdivisions of the corpus callosum, on a midsagittal brain section, were measured on magnetic resonance images obtained from 21 dyslexic and 29 control subjects. In the entire group, the frontal half of the horizontal brain section showed asymmetry, with the right side being larger, whereas posteriorly only the occipital polar segment was asymmetrical, with the left side being larger. Dyslexic subjects exhibited asymmetry, with the right side greater than the left side, in contrast to the relatively symmetrical pattern that is normally observed in the midposterior segment that corresponds to the angular gyrus. In the corpus callosum, dyslexic subjects were found to have a larger splenium than nondyslexic subjects, and dyslexic female subjects were found to have a larger splenium than dyslexic male subjects. Because transcallosal pathways connecting the left and right angular gyrus regions traverse through the splenium of the corpus callosum, the above findings in dyslexic subjects suggest an anatomic abnormality in the angular gyrus region."

The effect of ethanol ingestion on the efficacy of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nasal CPAP) as a treatment for the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome was studied in ten obese male subjects undergoing this therapy. On the first night of polysomnography, the lowest level of CPAP that maintained airway patency was determined (critical level). On the second (control) night (C), subjects slept the entire night on this level of CPAP. On the third night (E), subjects ingested either 1.5 ml/kg (part A, N = 6) or 2.0 ml/kg (part B, N = 4) of 50 percent ethanol (100 proof vodka) over one half-hour starting 1 h before bedtime. A serum ethanol level was obtained at bedtime (part A: 63.7 +/- 17.3 mg/dl; part B: 108.6 +/- 20.6 mg/dl), and subjects were monitored on the critical level of CPAP. Comparison of nights C and E for parts A + B showed no difference in total sleep time (TST) or the amount of different sleep stages as an absolute time or a percentage of TST except that there was more stage 2 (as a percent of TST) on E nights. The apnea + hypopnea index and C and E nights did not differ and was quite low (3.6 +/- 3.7/h vs 1.9 +/- 2.7/h). Similarly, ethanol ingestion did not increase the number of desaturations to at or below 90 and 85 percent, or lower the mean arterial oxygen saturation in NREM or REM sleep. Analysis of parts A and B separately also showed no differences with respect to the apnea + hypopnea index or the number of desaturations on control and ethanol nights. We conclude that acute moderate ethanol ingestion does not decrease the efficacy of an optimum level of nasal CPAP."

Striatocapsular infarction has recently been described as a distinct stroke entity and forms an important subgroup of subcortical infarctions. In a prospective study of 50 consecutive patients over a 10 yr period with this syndrome, clinical and neuropsychological features, pathogenesis and outcome were studied to provide information concerning management and prognosis. The most common clinical presentation was that of a stroke affecting mainly the upper limb with cortical signs such as dysphasia, neglect or dyspraxia. Evidence from EEG, angiographic and neuropsychological data supported a vascular/haemodynamic basis for the presence of the acute neuropsychological changes, while the chronic changes were more likely to be due to diaschisis. A study of risk factors and cerebral angiography enabled 4 pathophysiological subgroups to be identified: (1) cardiac emboli to the origin of the middle cerebral artery; (2) severe extra-cranial cranial carotid artery occlusive disease with presumed embolism to the same site and/or involvement of haemodynamic factors; (3) proximal middle cerebral artery abnormalities causing occlusion of multiple lateral striate arteries at their origins; (4) normal angiography where pathogenesis was uncertain. The risk factors of cardiac disease and smoking were significantly increased as compared with age and sex-matched controls with other forms of ischaemic stroke. Stroke or vascular death rate was 2.7% per yr during a mean follow-up period of 2.25 yrs. Predictors of an excellent recovery with return to normal lifestyle were younger age, only brachial or brachiofacial weakness with absence of cortical signs at presentation and minimal change on angiography. This stroke entity deserves particular recognition in the spectrum of subcortical infarctions because of its specific pathogenesis, distinct neuropsychological features and reasonable prognosis."

Twelve spinal cord-injured males performed arm-crank exercise (ACE) with and without concurrent functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) of paralyzed leg muscles to investigate the hypothesis that FNS would augment cardiovascular performance during submaximal ACE. Six men who exhibited vigorous isometric contractions of thigh and calf muscles were classed as \"responders\" to FNS (R), and the remaining subjects with poor or nonexistent contractions served as \"nonresponder controls\" (C). Steady-state heart rate and oxygen uptake during ACE at 30, 60, and 90 W were not appreciably different from the ACE + FNS condition. However, cardiac outputs in R were augmented by 30% during FNS at rest (from 4.9 to 6.4 l/min), by 18% during 30-W ACE + FNS (from 8.6 to 10.1 l/min), and by 28% during 90-W ACE + FNS (from 12.1 to 15.6 l/min). Similarly, resting stroke volumes were increased by 18% (9 ml) and by 23% (19 ml) at 60 W during FNS in the R group. Calculated total peripheral resistance was reduced at rest and during 90-W ACE + FNS by approximately 24%. In contrast, no alterations of circulatory hemodynamics were observed for C subjects. These data indicate that FNS-induced contractions of paralyzed leg muscles augment venous return to aid central cardiovascular control during upper-body submaximal exercise in paraplegics."

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of flexion-extension (F/E) cervical-spine radiographs in detecting acute cervical-spine instability in emergency patients. DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 141 consecutive trauma patients who had F/E views performed after a routine cervical-spine series (three views) was obtained in the emergency department. Interpretations of the routine series were compared with those of the F/E views to determine if additional useful information was provided by the latter. The charts also were reviewed to determine if any variables were associated with an increased use of F/E views, an increased likelihood of these views demonstrating instability, or any neurologic sequelae resulted from these studies. SETTING: An urban Level I adult trauma center. MEASUREMENTS: The interpretations of the routine series were noted to be either normal, abnormal but without demonstrable fracture/dislocation, or demonstrating a fracture/dislocation. The F/E views were categorized as stable, unstable, or uninterpretable. RESULTS: Cervical-spine instability was demonstrated by F/E views in 11 of the 141 patients (8%), four of whom had normal routine cervical-spine films. Three of these four patients required surgical stabilization. Prolonged neck pain (more than 24 hours), an initially abnormal spine series, and a neurosurgical consult were all associated with an increased use of F/E views. Ten of 11 patients with radiographic instability had significant neck pain by history; the remaining patient was intoxicated. No neurologic sequelae resulted from performing F/E studies. There was one false-negative F/E study, which raises concern about the reliability of this procedure in the ED. CONCLUSION: We believe that a large prospective study is required to determine which patients warrant F/E views."

Although the mortality rate among children with bacterial meningitis has decreased dramatically in recent decades, some patients are left with neurologic sequelae. It has not been clearly established which features of the acute illness predict the chronic neurologic sequelae, including late seizures or epilepsy. METHODS. We followed 185 infants and children prospectively during and after acute bacterial meningitis. The mean duration of follow-up was 8.9 years (range, 0.1 to 15.5). During the first six years standard neurologic examinations were performed; telephone interviews were conducted thereafter. RESULTS. One month after meningitis, 69 children (37 percent) had neurologic abnormalities. Many of these signs resolved within a year, leaving only 26 children (14 percent) with persistent deficits: 18 (10 percent) had only sensorineural hearing loss, and 8 (4 percent) had multiple neurologic deficits. Thirteen children (7 percent) had one or more late seizures not associated with fever. The presence of persistent neurologic deficits indicative of cerebral injury was the only independent predictor of late afebrile seizures (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. After bacterial meningitis only children with permanent neurologic deficits are at high risk for epilepsy. Those with normal examinations after the acute illness have an excellent change of escaping serious neurologic sequelae, including epilepsy."

    "abstract": "Approach to diagnosis of meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid evaluation. CSF evaluation is the single most important aspect of the laboratory diagnosis of meningitis. Analysis of the CSF abnormalities produced by bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal infections may greatly facilitate diagnosis and direct initial therapy. Basic studies of CSF that should be performed in all patients with meningitis include measurement of pressure, cell count and white cell differential; determination of glucose and protein levels; Gram's stain; and culture. In bacterial meningitis, Limulus lysate assay and tests to identify bacterial antigens may allow rapid diagnosis. Where there is strong suspicion of tuberculous or fungal meningitis, CSF should also be submitted for acid-fast stain, India ink preparation, and cryptococcal antigen; unless contraindicated by increased intracranial pressure, large volumes (up to 40-50 mL) should be obtained for culture. If a history of residence in the Southwest is elicited, complement-fixing antibodies to Coccidioides immitis should also be ordered. Newer tests based on immunologic methods or gene amplification techniques hold great promise for diagnosis of infections caused by organisms that are difficult to culture or present in small numbers. Despite the great value of lumbar puncture in the diagnosis of meningitis, injudicious use of the procedure may result in death from brain herniation. Lumbar puncture should be avoided if focal neurologic findings suggest concomitant mass lesion, as in brain abscess, and lumbar puncture should be approached with great caution if meningitis is accompanied by evidence of significant intracranial hypertension. Institution of antibiotic therapy for suspected meningitis should not be delayed while neuroradiologic studies are obtained to exclude abscess or while measures are instituted to reduce intracranial pressure."

Central programming deficits in Parkinson's disease (PD) were studied in two reaction time (RT) experiments. In Experiment 1, PD patients and controls performed sequences of hand postures that varied in length, the number of different postures (repetitive vs heterogeneous), and the delay interval before movement. Before movement, the PD group planned repetitive movements like controls whereas for heterogeneous sequences RT increased less with sequence length for the PD group, implying less preprogramming. The interresponse time (IRT) data from repetitive sequences showed that the PD group had difficulty controlling movement such that IRTs were faster when sequences were longer, thus allowing more time to schedule the termination of the sequence during the course of movement. For heterogeneous sequences, the PD group made more errors and were slower than controls when changing hand postures, suggesting a deficit in switching between different responses. While RT decreased with a longer delay similarly for both groups, IRT1 continued to improve only for the PD group but similarly for both types of sequences, suggesting a deficit specific to programming the first response. In Experiment 2, subjects made decisions about the number of different hand postures contained within a sequence. PD patients' decision times improved more with a longer delay only for heterogeneous sequences, suggesting a problem in identifying the number of different hand postures. The results have implications for levels of motor dysfunction in PD which emphasize the influence of sequence length and complexity."

Rehabilitation robotics is a research area, originating in engineering, that has emerged in the last decade. Its broad aim is to use robot technology to assist people with movement dysfunction. The neurologically impaired population might gain considerably from the provision of robots as \"assistants\" or \"therapy aides,\" but the interface with the machine must match both the physical and intellectual abilities of the user. We therefore consider a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing both behavioral and engineering perspectives, to be essential in achieving this aim. However, to date, published reports have been largely restricted to engineering journals or conference reports, and relatively little has appeared in the therapy literature.

The epilepsy (focal motor and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, subclinical EEG focal seizures during sleep, and atypical absences) always regressed spontaneously or with antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. The EEG in waking patients showed focal and generalized spike-wave discharges on a normal background rhythm. Discharge topography and pattern changed frequently. During sleep, discharges always increased. At some time during syndrome development, all patients had bilateral spike-waves for greater than 85% of the sleep period, while at other times the discharges were discontinuous or continuous but focal or unilaterally hemispheric. Discharge topography and abundance changed from night to night. The abnormal EEG and the impaired higher functions developed and regressed together, but not with strict temporal correlation. Our own experience suggests that the Landau-Kleffner syndrome and epilepsy with continuous spike-wave activity in slow-wave sleep cannot be clearly differentiated. They may be different points on the spectrum of a single syndrome."

    "abstract": "Thermographic findings in cranio-facial pain. This work assesses the differences in the thermographic findings in the craniofacial and neck areas between normal individuals and patients with craniofacial pain or headache, and investigates the influence of muscle contraction on such findings. Thermographic records were taken in 10 healthy subjects and 47 patients suffering from craniofacial pain or headache of different kinds. In the patients with painful episodes the record was taken between attacks. In all the normal subjects and in 19 patients lateral thermograms were also taken during and after maximal tooth clenching for three minutes. The majority of the patients, as compared to the normal group, showed some thermal alterations and asymmetry. Such alterations seem to be due both to vascular instability and muscle contraction: these two factors may be variably superimposed in the different conditions. In patients with cluster headache or chronic paroxysmal hemicrania the presence on the symptomatic side of a cold spot along the supraorbital area and/or the inner orbital canthus, was a constant finding. We conclude that thermography is useful as an additional diagnostic means in patients with head and face pain, and that the clenching test may increase the amount of information provided."

We prospectively studied the prognostic significance of conjugate eye deviation in 80 patients with acute stroke and compared the 3-month mortality and disability of these patients to those of the Tilburg epidemiological study of stroke. Mortality of patients with conjugate eye deviation was higher (41%) than for the general stroke population (34%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p less than 0.179). Looking at mortality and disability together, we found the outcome of patients with conjugate eye deviation to be significantly worse (p less than 0.001). Deviation of the eyes occurred more frequently to the right (65%) than to the left (35%). In the patient group with eye deviation to the left, mortality was significantly higher (64%, p less than 0.001) than in the group with eye deviation to the right (25%); only two patients of the former group (n = 28) could return home. Compared to the Tilburg epidemiological study of stroke, the group with eye deviation to the left did significantly worse, both for mortality alone (p less than 0.001) and for mortality and disability together (p less than 0.001). The group with eye deviation to the right did significantly worse only for mortality and disability together (p less than 0.01). Our results indicate that conjugate eye deviation is a prognostic factor for poor short-term mortality and disability in stroke patients, especially when the eyes are deviated to the left."

We describe a recent increase in the number of observed cases of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) in West Virginia. This is the fifth report of a recent increase in the incidence of ARF in the Ohio Valley area in the last 4 years. In contrast to the other reports, nearly two thirds of our cases of ARF were in adults, more than half of whom had suffered previous bouts of ARF. In these adults with recurrences, none was taking prophylactic penicillin at the time of presentation. Carditis was present in seven adults, two without a history of carditis. Arthritis was present in all adult patients. These data indicate a possible geographic phenomenon related to the increased number of observed cases of ARF and document that ARF is not simply a disease of childhood. Furthermore, our findings highlight the need for extended penicillin prophylaxis for secondary prevention of ARF, especially for those with an increased risk of acquiring a streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection."

In both cases, the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide were reversed in arterial blood gas analysis and %VC was less than 30%. Remission from respiratory failure has been obtained by the use of a ventilator during the night. The cause of the respiratory failure in both cases was severe restrictive respiratory dysfunction due to extreme flattening of the chest and fixation of the thorax during respiration as a result of contracture of costovertebral joints. All the previously reported cases of the rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure died. Appropriate use of the ventilator can improve the prognosis."

In the era of comparative and adjunctive trials in reperfusion therapy, the need to develop alternative end points for mortality reduction is clear. Left ventricular ejection fraction, which has been commonly used as a surrogate, is problematic due to missing values, technically inadequate studies, and lack of correlation with mortality results in controlled reperfusion trials performed to date. In this paper, we present a composite clinical end point that includes, in order, severity of adverse outcome death, hemorrhagic stroke, nonhemorrhagic stroke, poor ejection fraction (less than 30%), reinfarction, heart failure, and pulmonary edema.

The analysis of neuropsychological disorders of lexical processing has provided important clues about the general organization of the lexical system and the internal structure of the processing components. Reports of patients with selective dysfunction of specific semantic categories such as abstract versus concrete words, living things versus inanimate objects, animals, fruits and vegetables, proper names and so forth, support the hypothesis that the neural organization of the semantic processing component is organized in these categories. There are reports of selective dysfunction of the grammatical categories noun and verb, suggesting that a dimension of lexical organization is the grammatical class of words. But the results reported in these studies have not provided unambiguous evidence concerning two fundamental questions about the nature and the locus of this organization within the lexical system. Is the noun-verb distinction represented in the semantic or in the phonological and orthographic lexicons? Is grammatical-class knowledge represented independently of lexical forms or is it represented separately and redundantly within each modality-specific lexicon? Here we report the performance of two brain-damaged subjects with modality-specific deficits restricted principally (H.W.) or virtually only (S.J.D) to verbs in oral and written production, respectively. The contrasting performance suggests that grammatical-class distinctions are redundantly represented in the phonological and orthographic output lexical components."

    "abstract": "Diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. The diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea is frequently made by taking a meticulous history coupled with a high index of suspicion. Snoring and hypersomnolence are clinical features common to individuals with sleep apnea. Since snoring is said to be a \"disease of listeners,\" it is not uncommon that bed partners reported an increased incidence of depression and marital displeasure. It is for this reason that the spouse or bed partner should be interviewed, since the patient may not be aware of any sleeping problems. Physicians should also be alert to complaints of excessive daytime somnolence, because studies have shown that patients with obstructive sleep apnea are at increased risk for automobile crashes. It has been estimated that approx 58,000 motor vehicle accidents involving people with sleep apnea will occur in the US each yr. By proper diagnosis and treatment, the physician is in a unique position to prevent at least some of the automobile accidents that result from falling asleep while driving. Polysomnography is the only definitive way to obtain a diagnosis of sleep apnea. This allows the physician not only to diagnosis the disorder, but also helps in the evaluation of the severity of the syndrome and selection of therapy. An ENT evaluation is also important in ruling out anatomic disorders that can cause upper airway obstruction. Certain factors, such as alcohol and sedative ingestion, may aggravate the condition in a person predisposed to sleep apnea, and subtle changes, such as unexplained hypertension, polycythemia, and cor pulmonale, should lead one to investigate the possibility of sleep apnea as the etiology."

An important factor in the development of hypotension during hemodialysis (HD) is a decrease in blood volume, due to ultrafiltration (UF) and an insufficient refill of the intravascular compartment. This insufficient refill might be caused by a transcellular fluid shift from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment. We studied the influence of dialysate sodium concentration and UF rate on the refill rate, blood volume, intracellular (ICV) and extracellular fluid volume (ECV). Three different HD strategies were studied in 15 patients: (A) conventional HD (dialysate sodium 140 mmol/L); (B) HD with a sodium profile (140-148 mmol/L); and (C) HD with a sodium profile and a variable UF rate (high-low UF rate). ICV and ECV were measured by non-invasive conductivity measurements, blood volume was calculated from erythrocyte counts before and after treatment. Blood volume decrease was most pronounced during conventional HD, due to insufficient refilling without a detectable transcellular fluid shift. The sum of the decrease in ICV and EVC was less than during (B) and (C). The insufficient refill led to a higher prevalence of hypotension and cramps. The strategies (B) and (C) led to an significant and comparable transcellular fluid shift to the extracellular compartment. Thus, the use of a sodium profile led to a better intravascular refill and clinical tolerance of HD. Addition of a UF profile did not improve this any further."

Event-related potentials were recorded over occipital and parietal scalp from 20 patients suffering from intractable partial complex seizures prior to undergoing a temporal lobectomy. Subjects were presented with language and nonlanguage visual stimuli using a divided-field, \"odd-ball\" paradigm. Although behavioral performance (button-press accuracy, reaction time, and running counts) was comparable across all groups (although accuracy was worse for those in the left temporal group), patients showed tremendous variability in both the amplitude and latency of the P300 response. Particularly notable was the observation that more slow wave activity was present among the patients than among the control subjects, and those scheduled for a left temporal resection evinced more amplitude reduction than those scheduled for a right temporal resection. In addition, a number of patients appeared not to show a P300 response at all. These results are discussed in the context of the utility of using noninvasive event-related potential measures to examine both memory impairment and the integrity of the neural structures that mediate memory functioning in certain patient populations."

A statistically significant relationship was found between the frequency of headaches (P = .03) with level of depression. In fact, 74% of patients with headaches recurring almost every day had a clinically significant depression diagnosed as defined by the Zung SDS score. The Zung SDS score also correlated with the length of time that the problem of headache existed (P less than .05). Item analysis of the individual 20-item depression score revealed that four questions accounted for 93% of the variance. This analysis suggests that shorter, more abbreviated screening questions could be developed and refined in the future for use by the busy clinician. Headache is an important marker for depression in the primary care setting. It can be inferred from this study that the clinician may need to focus more on treating the entity of depression than on treating just the symptom of headache."

We have evaluated in a large series of rats (n = 136) the protective role of urea for the brain in the treatment of severe chronic hyponatraemia. Urea (group I, n = 51) was compared with hypertonic saline in boluses (group II, n = 46) and with hypertonic saline in divided doses (group III, n = 39). Treatment was administered intraperitoneally over 48 h. The severity of brain lesions was assessed by histological scoring. 2. For 95% of the injured animals treated with hypertonic saline, brain lesions appeared for an absolute increment in serum Na+ concentration (delta SNa+) of 20 mmol day-1 l-1. Above this limit neurological injuries gradually worsened, and beyond a transition zone (delta SNa+ greater than or equal to 20 less than or equal to 23 mmol day-1 l-1) 89% (group III) to 100% (group II) of the animals were injured. This limit can be reached rapidly, as attested by the comparable severity of brain lesions observed in group II (mean delta SNa+ 1 h after a bolus injection, 19 mmol/l) and in group III (mean delta SNa+ 1 h after an injection, 2 mmol/l), both groups achieving similar daily delta SNa+. 3.

Anton's syndrome is most commonly encountered in patients with bilateral occipital cortex lesions.

Our case demonstrates that Anton's syndrome may occur in association with blindness from a peripheral lesion, even in the absence of a delirium or significant dementia.

Shoulder pain is a common complaint and shoulder hyperostosis a frequent radiological condition. However, little is known about the association between the clinical and radiological findings. To evaluate the clinical relevance of shoulder hyperostosis we performed a controlled, blind study of 99 hospitalized probands with and without thoracospinal hyperostosis on lateral chest X-rays. The study included grading of the shoulder hyperostosis on the basis of three bilateral standard radiographs, assessing shoulder pain in a standardized way by an interviewer and recording extraskeletal causes of shoulder pain. The prevalence of shoulder hyperostosis was doubled in probands with thoracospinal hyperostosis compared to controls (chi 2 = 5.90, P less than 0.025, n = 99). Shoulder hyperostosis, irrespective of thoracospinal hyperostosis, predisposed to shoulder pain (40% versus 18%, chi 2 = 4.06, P less than 0.05, n = 74).

This study determined the physiologic responses to prolonged functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) leg-cycle exercise in seven quadriplegic and seven paraplegic subjects. Each subject completed 30 minutes of continuous FNS leg cycling during which open-circuit spirometry, impedance cardiography, auscultation, and fingertip capillary blood sampling were used to assess metabolic and hemodynamic responses. Compared with resting values, oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide production, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), pulmonary ventilation, heart rate (HR), left ventricular stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (Qt), and blood lactate (La) concentration were significantly (p less than .05) elevated, whereas plasma volume, bicarbonate concentration, and pH were significantly decreased in both groups during prolonged FNS leg-cycle exercise. Mean arterial pressure remained unchanged in quadriplegic and paraplegic subjects during the prolonged FNS leg-cycle exercise bout. Persons with quadriplegia elicited significantly lower MAP and tended to have lower SV and Qt responses than persons with paraplegia, probably due to a higher degree of sympathetic dysfunction and circulatory hypokinesis during FNS leg-cycle exercise. All other physiologic variables responded similarly between groups. We speculate that the relative increases observed for HR (33% to 60%), SV (45% to 69%), and Qt (113% to 142%) during prolonged FNS leg-cycle exercise create a sufficient cardiac-volume load to promote central cardiovascular conditioning in persons with both quadriplegia and paraplegia. The La accumulation (4.7 to 5.2 mmol.L-1) in the spinal cord injured during prolonged FNS leg cycling is unusually high for the power output attained (5.2W and 6.1W for quadriplegia and paraplegia, respectively)."

CT scan demonstrated a right posterior cerebral infarction and angiography showed irregular narrowing of the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery, suggestive of vasospasm. In the case no risk factors for atherosclerotic stroke were present except for smoking, and no other causes of stroke could be found."

    "abstract": "Evolution of energy expenditure and nitrogen excretion in severe head-injured patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of therapeutic changes on the level of energy expenditure (EE) and N excretion in a homogeneous group of patients usually considered hypermetabolic. DESIGN: EE and N excretion of head-injured patients were measured simultaneously at phases 1 and 2 (patients treated 4 +/- 3 and 18 +/- 8 days after injury, respectively). SETTING: Acute care hospital. PATIENTS: Eight severe head-injured patients, mean weight 63.1 +/- 6.1 (SD) kg, mean age 21 +/- 3.8 (SD) yr. INTERVENTIONS: At phase 1, all patients were sedated with fentanyl (6.7 +/- 1.9 micrograms/kg.hr) plus flunitrazepam (9.1 +/- 4.8 micrograms/kg.hr) and were mechanically ventilated. All patients received continuous total parenteral nutrition. The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1092 +/- 200 kcal/day, including 77% glucose and 23% fat (Intralipid 20%). The total N intake averaged 7 +/- 5 g/day, consisting of crystalline amino acids. At phase 2, no patient received any sedative and all were breathing spontaneously via tracheostomy. All patients received parenteral and/or enteral nutrition. The nonprotein caloric intake averaged 1929 +/- 200 kcal/day consisting of 65% carbohydrates and 35% fat. The total N intake averaged 13 +/- 2 g/day. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The EE was significantly higher at phase 2 than at phase 1 (2121 vs. 1737 kcal), but the interindividual variability was low at both phases. N excretion was high at the two periods of the study and not correlated to the level of EE. The RQ was 0.75 at both periods, indicating predominant fat oxidation. CONCLUSIONS: We could not demonstrate any parallelism in the evolution of EE and protein catabolism in head-injured patients. The therapeutics (mechanical ventilation, sedation, and nutrition) have a major effect on EE but little on N excretion."

Investigations of the association between autism and the fragile-X syndrome have yielded conflicting results with some studies indicating a strong correlation and others indicating no relation between the disorders. In this paper, we review the relevant research on this controversy and discuss the conceptual and methodological problems involved in such an inquiry. We conclude that autism and fragile X are associated and that this relation will prove fruitful in understanding the role of the X chromosome in a variety of behavior disorders and in unraveling various theoretical accounts on the etiology of autism."

    "abstract": "Verbal memory impairment correlates with hippocampal pyramidal cell density. Thirty-five patients with medically refractory epilepsy localized to the temporal lobe (18 left, 17 right) completed the verbal Selective Reminding Test before surgery. Verbal memory impairments existed before surgery regardless of the lateralization of the seizure focus, but patients with left temporal seizure foci were significantly more impaired. After surgical removal of the mesial temporal lobe structures, 2 blinded observers established volumetric cell densities for hippocampal subfields CA1, CA2, CA3, the hilar area, and the granule cell layer of the area dentata. Statistically significant correlations existed between presurgical memory impairment and cell counts (in CA3 and the hilar area, only) for patients with left temporal seizure foci. These findings support the hippocampal model of memory and complement prior research documenting the memory impairments present after surgical removal of the mesial temporal structures."

We describe patients from two different families with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and medically intractable trigeminal neuralgia.

Does the average daily blood pressure correlate with hypertensive cerebrovascular disease better than the casual pressure, as has been reported in other target organ involvement? We investigated the associations of two abnormal findings on brain magnetic resonance imaging suggestive of a vascular etiology, low intense foci (lacunae), and periventricular hyperintense lesions on T1- and T2-weighted images, with both office and average daily blood pressure values in a population of 73 healthy normotensive and hypertensive elderly individuals (70 +/- 6 years old). Lacunae were detected in 34 subjects (47%); the number per subject ranged from 0 to 19 and was significantly correlated with advancing age. Furthermore, these changes were supposedly related to the average of noninvasive ambulatory (24-hour and during awake and asleep periods) pressure recordings but not to office pressures. The grade of periventricular hyperintensity was also significantly associated with advancing age and the average of ambulatory systolic pressure recordings, particularly during sleep, but not with office blood pressure. In comparisons of normotensive, \"office hypertensive,\" and hypertensive subgroups, abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging were appropriate to the level of the 24-hour blood pressure measurements but not to that of clinic pressure. In hypertensive patients, the presence of electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy was also associated with greater abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging. We conclude that ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is superior to casual pressure measurements in predicting latent cerebrovascular disease, which is unexpectedly common in apparently healthy elderly subjects."

No significant changes could be detected in prevolley, field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSP) and population spike amplitude, while there was a minor, nonsignificant trend toward shortening of the population spike latency time. T3 had no effect on penicillin-induced epileptiform activity. There was, however, an active accumulation of radioactively labeled T3 in the slices. A rat cervaux-isole preparation was used to determine focal seizure thresholds in the visual cortex, and no acute (2-4 h) effects were demonstrated. No significant acute effects of T3 on brain excitability in the hippocampus and visual cortex was observed, despite an active accumulation of T3. Thus, the effect of T3 on brain excitability most likely is due to delayed effects."

A total of 157 epileptic patients were studied with respect to (1) biogenic amine precursors and metabolites in the CSF, (2) levels of folate and thiamine in the blood and CSF, (3) length of treatment with phenytoin (PHT), (4) PHT intoxication, (5) CNS atrophy. Alterations in CSF amine metabolite levels were related primarily to PHT intoxication, and low CSF folate and thiamine levels, but not to length of treatment or CNS atrophy. PHT intoxication increased CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA). Low folate levels were associated with decreased CSF 5HIAA and homovanillic acid, while low thiamine levels were associated with decreased CSF 5HIAA and 3-methyoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol. It remains to be seen to what extent these alterations in biogenic amine metabolism, mediated by low CNS vitamin levels, also lead to deficits in cerebral function."

We investigated the interrelationship of delayed amnesia, delayed neuronal death and changes in acetylcholine concentration induced by carbon monoxide (CO)-exposure in mice. In the test for retention of the passive avoidance task, amnesia was observed 5 and 7 days after CO-exposure when the mice were exposed to CO 1 day after training; in the case when the mice were exposed to CO 5 and 7 days before training, amnesia was also observed in a retention test given 1 day after training. The number of pyramidal cells in the hippocampal CA1 subfield was lower than that of the control 3, 5 and 7 days after CO-exposure. But the neurodegeneration in the parietal cortex, area 1, was not observed until 7 days after CO-exposure. The findings indicated that the amnesia and the neuronal death were produced after a delay when the mice were exposed to CO. In addition, the delayed amnesia was closely related to the delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 subfield. Moreover, [3H]glutamate and [3H]glycine binding sites did not change after CO-exposure but, 7 days after CO-exposure, the concentration of acetylcholine and the binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate in the frontal cortex and the striatum were found to have significantly changed, but those in the hippocampus did not show significant change. Therefore, we suggest that delayed amnesia induced by CO-exposure may result from delayed neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 subfield and dysfunction in the acetylcholinergic neurons, in the frontal cortex, the striatum and/or the hippocampus."

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that survivors of the Nazi Holocaust would have significantly more and different sleep problems than depressed and healthy comparison subjects and that the severity of the survivors' problems would be correlated with length of time spent in a concentration camp. Forty-two survivors, 37 depressed patients, and 54 healthy subjects of about the same age, all living in the community, described their sleep patterns over the preceding month on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, a self-rating instrument that inquires about quality, latency, duration, efficiency, and disturbances of sleep, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. RESULTS: The survivors had significantly greater sleep impairment than the healthy comparison subjects, as measured by all subscales of the index, but had less impairment than the depressed patients except on the sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction subscales. However, for specific items within these subscales, survivors had significantly more frequent awakenings due to bad dreams and had less loss of enthusiasm than the depressed subjects. Sleep disturbances and frequency of nightmares were significantly and positively correlated with the duration of the survivors' internment in concentration camps. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that for some Holocaust survivors, impaired sleep and frequent nightmares are considerable problems even 45 years after liberation."

Impact of specialized units This case-control study of 31 specialized dementia units and 32 traditional units in five states investigated use of physical and pharmacologic restraints among 625 patients with the diagnosis of dementia. Physical restraints were observed in use on 18.1% of dementia unit patients and on 51.6% of comparison unit patients who were out of bed during the day (adjusted odds ratio, 0.283;95% confidence interval, 0.129 to 0.619). Pharmacologic restraints were routinely given to 45.3% of dementia unit patients and 43.4% of comparison unit patients (adjusted odds ratio, 0.950; 95% confidence interval, 0.611 to 1.477). We used multivariate logistic regression to identify residence in a nonspecialized nursing home unit, nonambulatory status, transfer dependency, mental status impairment, hip fracture history, and a high nursing staff-to-patient ratio, which we found to be independent predictors of physical restraint use. Physically abusive behavior, severe mental status impairment, and frequent family visitation were found to be significant predictors of pharmacologic restraint use, while advanced patient age, large nursing home size, and patient nonambulatory status were protective against such use. These results support the conclusion that physical and pharmacologic restraint constitute separate treatment modalities with different risk factors for use, and indicate that specialized dementia units are successful in reducing the use of physical but not pharmacologic restraints."

    "abstract": "Hyponatraemia in patients with cirrhosis. Hyponatraemia occurs in nearly half of patients in hospital with cirrhosis and ascites, and is due to the excessive retention of free water which results from the kidney's inability to excrete it normally. The morbidity and mortality associated with hyponatraemia is largely attributable to central nervous system disturbances. The degree to which brain water content increases depends on the duration of hyponatraemia and on compensatory mechanisms. Altered steroid and peptide hormones in cirrhotic patients may contribute to the development of hyponatraemic encephalopathy, symptoms of which overlap with hepatic encephalopathy and uraemia. The occurrence of central pontine myelinolysis is unrelated to the rate of correction of hyponatraemia. The appearance of hyponatraemia in cirrhotic patients, long regarded as a poor prognostic sign, may be a function of unrecognized underlying impaired renal function. Therapy for hyponatraemia remains suboptimal."

The metabolic brain acidosis after trauma has been thought to be harmful and to contribute to neurological deterioration. Amelioration of the brain acidosis either by systemic buffering agents or by hyperventilation has been proposed as a method of treatment. The objective of this study was to explore with magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy the metabolic changes in brain that occur with the use of hyperventilation, THAM (tromethamine; tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane), and a combination (THAM and hyperventilation) therapy in experimental fluid-percussion injury. Brain lactate, brain pH, inorganic phosphate (Pi), and adenosine triphosphate levels were measured by 1H and 31P MR spectroscopy. Arterial and cerebrovenous lactate and water content in brain tissue was determined in 29 cats using the specific gravimetric technique. Following injury, the phosphocreatine (PCr)/Pi ratio, which is an index of cerebral energy depletion, decreased to 76% in four untreated animals, to 79% in 11 THAM-treated animals, to 68% in seven animals receiving hyperventilation, and to 66% in seven animals with combination THAM and hyperventilation therapy. The PCr/Pi ratio returned to a normal level in 8 hours in animals treated with THAM and THAM in combination with hyperventilation. The brain lactate index increased to 157% in the hyperventilation group after trauma. In cats receiving THAM plus hyperventilation, the brain lactate index was reduced to 142%, while the minimum rise of 126% was associated with treatment of THAM alone. In the THAM-treatment and combination-treatment groups, the water content of the white and gray matter was significantly decreased compared with that in untreated cat brains. Prolonged hyperventilation provided relative ischemia in brain tissue and promoted more production of brain lactate, no recovery of the PCr/Pi ratio, and no decrease in brain edema. On the other hand, administration of THAM decreased production of brain lactate and brain edema and promoted the recovery of cerebral energy dysfunction. It was found that THAM ameliorates the deleterious effects of hyperventilation by minimizing energy disturbance and that it also decreases brain edema. The authors conclude that THAM may be effective in reducing brain tissue acidosis and helpful as a metabolic stabilizing agent following severe head injury."

The administration of the drug or matching placebo was started immediately after the radiological diagnosis of a ruptured aneurysm had been made. Of the 213 patients enrolled in the study, 58 were operated on early (within 72 hours after the bleed: Days 0 to 3), 69 were operated on subacutely (between Days 4 and 7), and 74 had late surgery (on Day 8 or later). Eleven patients died before surgery was undertaken and one was not operated on. A follow-up examination with CT scanning, performed 1 to 3 years after the SAH (mean 1.4 years), revealed no significant differences in the overall outcome between the groups. However, nimodipine treatment was associated with a significantly lower incidence of deaths caused by delayed cerebral ischemia (p = 0.01) and significantly lower occurrence of cerebral infarcts visualized by CT scanning in the whole population (p = 0.05), especially in patients without an associated intracerebral hemorrhage on admission CT scan (p = 0.03)."

Hypertension occurred less frequently in male patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (4%) than in control subjects (30%; OR = .10). Because of small population size, no conclusions can be drawn with respect to the following antecedent conditions: thyroid disease (OR = 1.61), coronary artery disease (OR = .58), obesity (OR = .52), diabetes (OR = 1.00), cerebrovascular disease (OR = .21), and peripheral vascular disease (OR = 1.23). The heterogeneity of antecedent thyroid disease makes it highly unlikely that any specific thyroid lesion is causally associated with most cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

Female sex steroid receptors were examined in 50 human cerebral meningiomas. For estrogen receptors, high-affinity binding sites (dissociation constant (Kd): 0.05 to 0.2 nM) were found in the cytosolic fraction with a capacity of less than 4 fmol/mg protein in 10 meningiomas using a dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) assay. In the same cytosolic fraction, the solid-phase enzyme immunoassay revealed only one cytosol with a positive colorimetric reaction equal to 5 fmol/mg protein. However, in the nuclear compartment, none of the tumors stained positively for estrogen receptors with immunohistochemical techniques. In addition, the most convincing evidence for the absence of estrogen receptors was obtained by in situ hybridization using an oligonucleotide probe complementary to a fraction of the human receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). In none of the 50 meningiomas was the expression of estrogen mRNA coding for the estrogen receptor detected. For progesterone receptors, high-affinity binding sites (Kd: 0.3 to 2.6 nM) were found in 49 of the 50 tumors using a DCC assay. In the same cytosols, solid-phase enzyme immunoassay revealed that each tumor was positive for progesterone receptors. However, in the nuclear compartment, only five tumors had partially positive staining for progesterone receptors with immunohistochemical techniques. Within the confines of this study, it is concluded that: 1) the estrogen receptor is generally absent in meningioma tissue, and 2) the progesterone receptor is mainly absent in the nuclear compartment, leading to the conclusion that the cytosolic progesterone receptor may be an inactive form. This study suggests that female sex steroid receptors are not primarily involved in the proliferative rate of cerebral meningiomas and that they are of no current significance as markers for adjuvant medical therapy of most meningiomas."

During neurosurgical operations for the relief of movement disorders, single thalamic neurons (n = 107) were identified with activity which was related to verbally cued active movements (movement-related cells). The activity of each neuron was examined during different contralateral movements in order to determine the movement which was associated with the most consistent and pronounced change in firing rate (the optimal response). The optimal response was determined by analysis of histograms of neuronal activity which were constructed by using the onset of EMG activity to synchronize successive repetitions of the active movement. Movement-related cells exhibited optimal responses associated with such movements as making a fist, extension or flexion of the wrist, flexing or extending the elbow, pointing with the entire upper extremity, extending the tongue and lifting the leg. Most movement-related cells recorded in a single parasagittal plane in an individual patient had optimal responses related to movements involving the same part of the body. Movement-related cells were classified into those that were activated in response to somatosensory stimulation (combined cells, n = 20) and those which were not (voluntary cells, n = 87). Combined cells were activated in advance of EMG activity during active movement and so could be distinguished from cells responding only to sensory stimulation (sensory cells). Movement-related cells (combined and voluntary cell types) were located anterior to sensory cells and tended to show a mediolateral somatotopic organization parallel to that of sensory cells with cutaneous receptive fields. Combined cells responded to somatosensory stimulation of the same part of the body as that involved in the active movement related to the optimal response of the cell. Combined cells responding to passive movements of a joint always had their optimal response during active movement about the same joint. The activity of combined cells during parkinsonian tremor may clarify the role of sensory feedback in tremor."

A method is presented for investigating the response of passive and active muscle to experimentally induced deep muscle pain. Ten healthy adult males performed multiple, submaximal isometric neck flexion tasks before and after pain had been induced in the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle by injecting 5 ml of a hypertonic (5%) saline solution. A similar volume of isotonic saline was injected into the contralateral muscle as a control. Cervical myoelectric signal (MES) root-mean-square (RMS) response to each injection was recorded from eight neck muscles over 8 minutes. The subject rated perceived pain at regular intervals using a visual analog scale (VAS). Sternocleidomastoid pain, which reached a mean of 36 mm on the 100-mm VAS 2 minutes after the injection, resulted in significantly increased (1-2 microV, P less than 0.05) RMS MES in the otherwise relaxed SCM muscle during the first 2 minutes. This was followed by a gradual return to control values after 5 minutes. A similar trend in MES was found for the active SCM muscle during a 10% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) isometric neck flexion effort. Thus, acute deep muscle pain caused subtle, yet systematic, changes in motor output in both the relaxed and active painful muscle, and its synergists and antagonists."

Median and quartile survival times were greater in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy (group 1, 30 and 50 months; group 4, 20 and 25 months) than in patients who did not receive chemotherapy after RT (group 2, 13 and 20 months; group 3, 15 and 24 months). These results suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy is useful in the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma."

    "abstract": "Late effects of paralytic poliomyelitis in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We identified a cohort of 300 individuals who had paralytic polio between 1935 and 1955. All lived in Olmsted County, Minnesota. From the 247 survivors, we selected 50 subjects for detailed historical, functional, psychological, clinical, and electrophysiologic evaluation. Sixty-four percent of these 50 survivors complained of new symptoms of muscle pain, fatigue, and weakness after a period of prolonged stability. This led to changes in lifestyle or activity in only 18%. The likelihood of expressing new complaints was not related to present age or interval since polio, and electrophysiologic testing did not distinguish between those with or without new problems. The development of new difficulties in a limb was most strongly predicted by significant paralysis of that limb at the time of the acute illness. Patients with leg weakness were twice as likely to complain of new problems compared to those with arm weakness. Elevated creatine kinase levels were present only in those with new complaints."

We measured cerebrospinal fluid endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 levels in five groups of patients: normal controls, patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm, patients with severe head injuries, patients undergoing temporal lobectomy for intractable epilepsy, and a patient with a gunshot injury to the thoracic spine. Endothelin-3 levels were significantly elevated in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and may participate in cerebral vasospasm and subsequent neurologic deterioration."

A patient suffering from syringobulbia and syringomyelia exhibited a phasic contraction of the ipsilateral facial muscles, mainly the levator labii, whenever he looked to the left or right. Facial muscle twitches occurred exclusively with saccades. The selective co-activation of abducens and facial nerves is interpreted as the result of bilateral misrouting of regenerating neurons from the parapontine reticular formation to the facial nerve in the tegmentum pontis."

From 1971 to 1985, 393 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) were performed in patients for rheumatoid arthritis. Of these, 112 used polycentric prostheses and 131 used total condylar prostheses. One hundred seven of the patients with polycentric prostheses and 102 of the patients with total condylar prostheses were followed for a minimum of two years (average, 61 and 55 months, respectively). At the time of the latest examination, nine knees with polycentric prostheses required revision surgery: six for tibial component loosening and instability and three for patellofemoral pain. Five knees with total condylar prostheses required revision: one for chronic instability, one for a late posttraumatic patellar fracture, and three for late hematogenous infections. The total condylar prostheses with patellar resurfacing had better scores for pain (8.5 points) than the polycentric prosthesis without patellofemoral resurfacing (7.0 points). The total condylar prosthesis appeared more durable in terms of fixation, with no evidence of aseptic loosening of femoral or tibial components noted in this series thus far."

We treated 40 eyes of 40 patients by using noncontact transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation to determine whether treatment 1.5 or 3.0 mm posterior to the corneoscleral lumbus was preferable. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the treatment groups, and all other variables, including power, number, and distribution of laser applications, were kept constant. Six months postoperatively, those treated 1.5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus had a lower intraocular pressure (P = .0047) than those treated 3.0 mm from the corneoscleral limbus. The 1.5-mm group also required fewer retreatment (P = .017) and had a slightly lower occurrence of visual acuity loss after this procedure. We believe it may be advantageous to locate the laser application approximately 1.5 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus, rather than further posteriorly, when performing noncontact transscleral Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation."

    "abstract": "Implications of a dynamical systems approach to understanding infant kicking behavior. Implications of the dynamical systems approach to understanding movement dysfunction in infants are discussed. Traditional theories of motor development attribute changes in movement to the hierarchical maturation of the central nervous system. The dynamical systems approach emphasizes that movement self-organizes as the result of the interaction of the participating subsystems in developmental and real time. In this article, I discuss, from the theoretical perspective of the dynamical systems approach, the organization of leg movements in low- and high-risk preterm and full-term infants, developmental changes in movement in low-risk preterm infants from 34 weeks' gestational age to 40 weeks' postgestational age, and differences in movement between low-risk preterm infants at 40 weeks' postgestational age and full-term infants. Preliminary data on high-risk preterm infants are presented. Based on these data, the necessity to review and reinterpret traditional concepts of motor development is explored. Suggestions are offered and questions posed on how the dynamical systems perspective may influence the practice of physical therapy in the evaluation, and treatment of infants at risk for movement dysfunction."

    "abstract": "Diagnostic evaluation of syncope Syncope is a common medical problem and is caused by a wide variety of diseases ranging from physiologic derangements with few consequences to conditions that may be immediately life-threatening. Because of the large differential diagnosis, many diagnostic tests are available for its evaluation. However, a cause of syncope is not established in 38% to 47% of patients despite these tests. In those patients in whom a diagnosis can be assigned, the history and physical examination identify a potential cause in 49% to 85%. Furthermore, in 8% of additional patients, history and physical examination are suggestive of causes that need confirmation by specific tests. Routine blood tests rarely yield diagnostically helpful information. In those patients in whom a potential cause for syncope is identified, arrhythmias are diagnosed by electrocardiogram in 2% to 11% of patients, cardiac monitoring in 3% to 27% (telemetry or Holter), stress test in less than 1%, carotid massage in less than 1%, and electrophysiologic studies in less than 3%. Diagnosis of arrhythmias as a cause of syncope is problematic because symptomatic correlation during electrocardiographic monitoring is rarely found (approximately 4%), and as a result, there is no uniform agreement on diagnostic criteria for abnormalities. Similar problems exist in the use of electrophysiologic studies. Upright tilt testing and psychiatric examination may be useful in evaluation of recurrent syncope of unknown cause in patients without organic heart disease. Based on the results of recent studies, strategies for evaluation of patients with syncope are possible that utilize selective and goal-directed diagnostic testing."

    "abstract": "Rate of oxyhemoglobin desaturation in obstructive versus nonobstructive apnea. Preapneic thoracic gas volume (Vtg), arterial saturation (SaO2), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), have been shown to influence the rate of SaO2 fall (dSaO2/dt) during apnea. We asked the following question: does tissue oxygen consumption (tVO2) affect the dSaO2/dt during apnea? We attempted to answer this question by comparing dSaO2/dt during obstructive apneas (high tVO2) with dSaO2/dt during nonobstructive apneas (low tVO2) in six adult baboons. Fiberoptic central venous and arterial catheters were used for continuous monitoring of SvO2, SaO2, and cardiac output. A sapphire-bearing turbine monitored minute ventilation and airflow cessation. A Respitrace and esophageal pressures were used to assess relative differences in Vtg. Obstructive apneas (30, 45, and 60-s) were created by clamping an indwelling cuffed endotracheal tube at end-expiration. Nonobstructive apneas were created by paralyzing the animals with atracurium and interrupting ventilation for periods equivalent to those of the obstructed apneas. The ventilator was adjusted to duplicate the respiratory rate, tidal volume, and relative Vtg of the spontaneously breathing animal. Mean tVO2 during spontaneous breathing was 110 ml/min (Fick method) and decreased to 90 ml/min during paralysis (p less than 0.05). The dSaO2/dt for the three apnea durations (mean, all animals), obstructive versus nonobstructed were: 0.85 and 0.74%/s (n = 6), 0.87 and 0.75%/s (n = 6), and 0.60 and 0.48%/s (n = 4), respectively. The dSaO2/dt was significantly lower during the nonobstructive apneas. We conclude that differences in VO2 during apnea may affect the dSaO2/dt and that for the same duration apnea, central apneas may show less desaturation than obstructive apneas where vigorous muscular efforts at overcoming obstruction are common."

Local changes in cerebral glucose utilization during the postictal phase of amygdaloid-kindled generalized seizures were studied with the quantitative autoradiographic 2-[14C]deoxyglucose method in conscious rats. Measurement was initiated either just after termination of a behavioral seizure (GS-I) or 30 s after seizure termination (GS-II) to determine dynamic metabolic changes in the postictal phase. Although glucose utilization of the neocortex was remarkably depressed in both GS-I and GS-II, that of the hippocampus significantly increased in GS-I and then decreased in GS-II as compared with control. These changes of hippocampal glucose utilization were observed in all sectors of the pyramidal cell layer (CA 1-4) and in the molecular layer. Because metabolic changes associated with development of amygdaloid-kindled seizures begin in the limbic structures including the hippocampus, the transient increase in hippocampal glucose utilization observed in the early postictal phase indicates that the hippocampus is one of the key structures not only for initiating and maintaining but also for terminating kindled seizures."

Locus of control (LOC) beliefs, long thought important in adjustment to persistent pain, were studied among 160 subjects (67 males and 93 females) referred to a comprehensive pain rehabilitation program. The subscale structure of the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) was factorially replicated in our sample. Three unique MHLC profile clusters were identified for both males and females. Among men, cluster assignment was related to age only. The younger male patients reported a stronger internal attributional style. Older male patients relied more heavily on both chance and powerful other factors. Among women, cluster assignment was related to the use of coping strategies. For example, patients with high internal scores only, reflecting a strong internal orientation towards self-management of health care needs, were more likely to utilize Information-Seeking, Self-Blame, and Threat Minimization coping strategies than patients with high scores on both the Internal and Powerful Other factors. It appears that the presence of both Internal and Powerful Other health attributional styles is associated with less frequent use of cognitive self-management techniques. In understanding the LOC scores it is important to rely on pattern analysis of scores. Implications for clinical treatment are discussed."

Abnormal thermographic studies were instrumental in uncovering intermittent compression of the subclavian artery, and this prompted us to study the effects of cello playing on skin temperature asymmetry. Temperature asymmetry was defined as the temperature difference (delta-T) from one hand to the other. In 57 controls, mean delta-T at rest was .309 +/- .254C. Exercising the upper extremities by prolonged elbow flexion or by movements mimicking cello playing in controls did not significantly affect delta-T. In our patient, delta-T was ten times control (3.6C). Angiography showed extrinsic compression of the subclavian artery occurring only after cello playing; sympathetic ganglion block relieved the pain. Our patient's abnormal skin temperature may have reflected sympathetic vasomotor hyperactivity. Intermittent neurovascular compression and sympathetic hyperactivity appear to be factors in scalenus anticus syndrome."

It is controlled by both the intrinsic and extrinsic nerves of the gastrointestinal tract and, to a lesser degree, the gastrointestinal hormones. Therefore, any abnormality of the above factors, theoretically, can cause gastrointestinal dysmotility. In a clinical situation, commonly seen is gastrointestinal dysmotility caused by either smooth muscle or intrinsic and extrinsic nerves dysfunction. Diseases that cause smooth muscle dysfunction include familial visceral myopathies, nonfamilial visceral myopathies, collagen disease, muscular dystrophies, amyloidosis, thyroid disease, and so on. Diseases that cause enteric nerve dysfunction include familial visceral neuropathies, nonfamilial visceral neuropathies, diabetes mellitus, Chagas' disease, ganglioneuromatosis of the intestine, visceral neuropathy of carcinomatosis, Parkinson's disease, and so on. The patients with neuromuscular disease of the gastrointestinal tract have a wide range of clinical manifestations regardless of the underlying cause. At one end of the spectrum, the patients may be asymptomatic, and at the other end of the spectrum, the patients may have functional obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. Plain abdominal x-rays, upper gastrointestinal (UGI) and small bowel x-rays, enteroclysis, barium enema, and manometric studies are useful for the work-up of these patients. Enteroclysis is especially helpful in ruling out mechanical obstruction of the small intestine in patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. There is no effective drug to improve gastrointestinal motility. Surgery may be helpful in selected cases of severe gastrointestinal dysmotility."

Ninety (73%) of the fibromyalgia patients reported altered bowel function as compared to 20 (37%) DJD patients and none of the normal controls (P less than 0.001). Ninety-nine patients (81%) reported normal alternating with irregular bowel pattern, and 77 (63%) had alternating diarrhea and constipation. In contrast, only 24 (44%) of DJD patients and six (13%) of controls had regular alternating with irregular bowel pattern and only 12 (22%) of the DJD patients and none of the healthy controls had alternating constipation and diarrhea (P less than 0.01). Other bowel dysfunction complaints noted in the fibromyalgia group were abdominal gas (59%), nausea (21%), diarrhea (9%), and constipation (12%). Seventy-nine (64%) fibromyalgia patients reported frequent abdominal pain that was stress-related 47% of the time. Laxative use was frequent in the fibromyalgia group (19%) and absent in the other two groups. Fifty percent of fibromyalgia patients, compared to 28% of DJD patients, felt that their bowel complaints were worse during exacerbations of their joint disease (P less than 0.05). In conclusion, patients with fibromyalgia have a high prevalence of gastrointestinal complaints that should be carefully assessed. If the diagnosis of IBS is confirmed, appropriate treatment may improve patients' symptoms, although this approach requires further study."

We performed unenhanced computed tomographic scans on 141 asymptomatic patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Thirty-six patients (26%) had hypodense areas consistent with cerebral infarction. The majority of these were small deep infarcts, seen in 29 patients (21%), but 13 patients (9%) had cortical or large deep infarctions. Twelve patients had more than one infarct on computed tomographic scan. Increasing age and increased left atrial diameter were the only clinical features associated with asymptomatic infarction. Patients older than 65 years with a left atrial diameter greater than 5.0 cm (n = 23) had a 52% prevalence of asymptomatic infarction. Patients younger than 65 years with a left atrial diameter less than 5.0 cm (n = 38) had an 11% prevalence of silent infarction. Patients with only one of these risk factors (n = 72) had a 24% prevalence of silent infarction. Infarction was more common in those with chronic (34%) as opposed to intermittent (22%) nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, but this difference was not significant. Hypertension, diabetes, duration of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, history of myocardial infarction, and echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction were not associated with asymptomatic infarction. A history of hypertension was present in only 35% of our patients with small-deep asymptomatic infarction, similar to the percentage in patients without stroke. Asymptomatic cerebral infarction is common in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. The association with enlarged left atria and the lack of correlation with major cerebrovascular risk factors suggests a cardioembolic mechanism. Further study is needed to determine the functional and prognostic significance of these strokes."

With neuroleptic anesthesia and a transfemoral femoral approach, a silicone micro-balloon can be flow directed through the intracranial circulation, guided directly into the aneurysm, and detached. The aneurysm is thus eliminated from the circulation, and the parent artery is preserved. For broad-based or ectatic aneurysms, test occlusion followed by permanent occlusion of the aneurysm and parent vessel can be performed. Since 1981, 211 patients with 215 aneurysms, including 177 cases involving the anterior and 38 cases involving the posterior circulation, have been treated with this technique. In 127 cases (59.1%), the parent vessel was occluded; in 88 cases (40.9%), primary occlusion of the aneurysm was achieved with preservation of the parent artery. Therapy-related complications included 21 deaths (9.8%) and 16 strokes (7.4%). Follow-up examinations were performed at 1, 3, and 12 months after treatment, and follow-up ranged from 5 months to 9 years.

This study evaluated the role of duplex scanning in the management of patients with normal or minimally diseases carotid arteries. Carotid duplex scans were interpreted according to previously established criteria and considered normal when pulsed Doppler spectral waveforms showed laminar flow or only minor flow disturbances. Normal flow patterns were noted by duplex scanning in 100 carotid bifurcations of 72 patients who also underwent carotid arteriography. Neurologic symptoms (amaurosis fugax, transient ischemic attack, or stroke) were present in relation to 23 arteries and absent in relation to 77 arteries. On the 23 symptomatic sides arteriography was interpreted as normal in eight, 1% to 15% stenosis in 14, and 16% to 40% stenosis in one. For the 77 asymptomatic sides, arteriography showed normal vessels in 15, 1% to 15% stenosis in 43, and 16% to 40% stenosis in 19. One symptomatic patient was treated by carotid endarterectomy for an irregular 1% to 15% stenosis. None of the asymptomatic lesions were in the range of 80% to 99% stenosis, which would justify endarterectomy for asymptomatic disease. Clinical follow-up for a mean interval of 28 months on 20 of the 22 symptomatic patients not undergoing surgery revealed no strokes and transient recurrent symptoms in two patients. Assuming that the single operation in this study was indicated, duplex scanning correctly identified lesions not requiring carotid endarterectomy in 96% (22/23) of the symptomatic patients. A normal duplex scan also predicted a benign clinical outcome without operation. Duplex scanning can reliably exclude surgically treatable carotid bifurcation lesions in asymptomatic patients, and endarterectomy is rarely indicated in symptomatic patients with normal duplex scan results. This study supports a nonoperative therapeutic approach for most patients with neurologic symptoms and a normal carotid duplex scan on the appropriate side."

We examined variations in interictal spiking during sleep and wakefulness to assess differences in reliability for localizing epileptic foci. Forty patients were studied prospectively. Spikes were assessed for rates, field, and appearance of new foci. Final localization was determined by surgery, electrocorticography, and seizure onset. Comparison of interictal EEG foci with final localization was made. In 39 patients, slow-wave sleep activated spiking compared with wakefulness. Most patients showed maximal spiking in sleep stages 3 or 4. Restriction of field in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness, and extension of field in slow-wave sleep occurred. New foci appeared in non-rapid eye movement sleep in 53% of patients. Similar but not identical spiking rates, foci, and field distributions were seen in wakefulness and REM sleep. All REM foci were unilateral. Our findings suggest that localization of the primary epileptogenic area is more reliable in REM sleep than in wakefulness, and in wakefulness more than in slow-wave sleep."

By using in vitro and ex vivo autoradiographic techniques, the localization of specific binding sites for 3H-dihydroergotamine in the cat brain has been examined. Binding was seen in the dorsal horn of the cervical spinal cord, in the medulla, associated with the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, area postrema, and descending spinal trigeminal nucleus, and in the mesencephalon and the cerebral cortex. The highest density of binding sites was found in the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei of the midbrain. Furthermore, these same brain regions were also labeled after intravenous administration of 3H-dihydroergotamine. It is important that the brain areas specifically labeled are key nuclei involved in cranial pain transmission, suggesting that dihydroergotamine may act at these central sites in migraine."

    "abstract": "Valgus deformities of the feet and characteristics of gait in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis. To investigate the cause of valgus deformity of the hindfoot in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis and to characterize the effects of the deformity on gait, two groups of patients were evaluated clinically, radiographically, and with gait analysis in the laboratory. Group 1 consisted of seven patients who had seropositive rheumatoid arthritis and normal alignment of the feet and Group 2, of ten patients who had rheumatoid arthritis and valgus deformity of the hindfoot. In Group 2, the disease was of longer duration and the feet were more painful than in Group 1. There was no evidence of muscular imbalance, equinus contracture, valgus deformity of the tibiotalar joint, or isolated deficiency of the tibialis posterior (such as weakness, tenosynovitis, or rupture of the tendon) that could have contributed to the development of the valgus deformity. In the patients who had valgus deformity, quantitated electromyography demonstrated that the intensity and duration of activity of the tibialis posterior was significantly increased, apparently in an effort to support the collapsing longitudinal arch of the foot. Gait studies revealed decreases in velocity, stride length, and single-limb-support time, as well as delayed heel-rise in both groups, but the decreases were more marked in the patients who had valgus deformity. The results of this study suggest that valgus deformity of the hindfoot in rheumatoid patients results from exaggerated pronation forces on the weakened and inflamed subtalar joint. These forces are caused by alterations in gait secondary to symmetrical muscular weakness and the effort of the patient to minimize pain in the feet. Radiographs also suggested an association between the valgus deformity of the feet and valgus deformity of the knees in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis."

    "abstract": "Heritability of symptoms in an experimental model of neuropathic pain. Male and female rats underwent transection and ligation of the sciatic and saphenous nerves, and the development of autonomy was monitored. The deafferented animals were then interbred, always selecting males and females that expressed relatively high and, alternatively, relatively low levels of autotomy. Offspring were similarly operated and interbred. By the sixth generation of selective breeding, lines were achieved in which autotomy was consistently high (HA) or consistently low (LA). There was no indication of sex linkage. Thermal and mechanical nocifensive responsiveness co-selected with propensity to express autotomy following nerve injury: response thresholds were lower in HA than in LA rats. F1 hybrids formed by crossing homozygous HA and LA animals showed low levels of autotomy, similar to LA stock. This indicates recessive inheritance of the autotomy trait. Backcrossing F1 hybrids onto the LA line yielded a low autotomy phenotype in almost all cases; backcrossing F1 hybrids onto HA stock yielded about 50% high autotomy and 50% low autotomy. These ratios are consistent with simple mendelian inheritance of a single gene. Taken together, the data suggest that autotomy is inherited as a single-gene autosomal recessive trait."

A subjective assessment of confusion must be followed by an objective systematic evaluation to develop the cognitive-behavior profile. Because of age-associated physiologic and pathologic changes, elderly patients are at high risk for developing acute confusion. The management of confusion presents a challenge to nursing. Nursing can play a significant role in the prevention and the early detection of acute confusion. Preventing or identifying confusion early will decrease the physical and psychological stress of the patient as well as decrease the cost of hospitalization by shortening length of stay.

This experiment was designed to determine if nitrous oxide alters neurologic and pathologic outcome from temporary focal cerebral ischemia in spontaneously hypertensive rats deeply anesthetized with a barbiturate. Two groups of rats were given intravenous methohexital such that a stable EEG pattern of burst suppression was achieved. In one group of rats (n = 11), the lungs were mechanically ventilated with 70% N2O/30% O2, and in the other group (n = 10), ventilation was done with 70% nitrogen/30% O2. The middle cerebral artery was then occluded for 2 h, during which time mean arterial pressure, blood gases, hematocrit, plasma glucose, and head temperature were held constant between groups. The total doses of methohexital administered were similar in both groups as were the plasma methohexital concentrations immediately prior to onset of ischemia. After reperfusion of the middle cerebral artery, the animals were allowed to awaken. Neurologic evaluations were performed prior to ischemia and at 24 and 96 h postischemia. Cerebral infarct volume was measured at 96 h postischemia using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining and computer imaging techniques. There were no neurologic differences between the N2O and nitrogen groups at any experimental interval although both groups exhibited deficits at both 24 and 96 h postischemia relative to preischemic values.

Exercise has been shown to be effective in preventing glucocorticoid-induced atrophy in muscles containing high proportions of type II or fast-twitch fibers. This investigation was undertaken to further evaluate this response in type IIa and IIb fibers, determined by histochemical staining for myofibrillar adenosinetriphosphatase with alkaline and acid preincubation. Steroid [cortisol acetate (CA), 100 mg/kg body wt] and exercise (running 90 min/day, 29 m/min) treatments were initiated simultaneously for 11 consecutive days in female rats. Fiber distribution and area measurements were performed in a deep and superficial region of plantaris muscle. The exercise regimen spared approximately 40% of the CA-induced plantaris muscle atrophy. In the deep region, the fiber population, which contained approximately 13% type I (slow-twitch), 24% type IIa, and 63% IIb fibers, was not affected by either treatment. In the superficial section, which consisted solely of type II fibers, the proportion of type IIa fibers was higher (27 vs. 9%, P less than 0.01) in the steroid- than in the vehicle-treated groups. Within each region, type IIa fibers were less susceptible to atrophy than type IIb fibers, and within each fiber type, the deep region had less atrophy than the superficial region. Type I fibers were unchanged by steroid treatment. For type IIa fibers, exercise prevented 100% of the atrophy in the deep region and 50% in the superficial region. For type IIb fibers, the activity spared 67 and 40% of the atrophy in these same regions, respectively. These results show that glucocorticoids are capable of changing the myosin phenotype."

We describe several new possibilities for the study of degenerated myelinated tracts in the human central nervous system (CNS). The methods are based on the visualization of myelin breakdown products that show birefringence in polarized light and, when stained with Nile blue and benzpyrene-3,4, exhibit fluorescence. Even after lengthy formalin fixation, the methods permit the localization of anterogradely degenerated tracts in a variety of fiber systems in the brains of patients who died between five and 20 months after the onset of neurological symptoms. Particularly the polarizing technique, because of its simplicity, can be added to the usual neuropathological methods for demonstrating the long-distance effects of a brain lesion. As research tools, these methods would also aid in the study of the anatomical substrate of human neurological symptomatology."

Transcutaneous cranial electrical stimulation (TCES) with high frequency (166 kHz) intermittent current (100 Hz: Limoge current) has been used for several years in cardiac, thoracic, abdominal, urological and micro-surgery. The main benefits are a reduced requirement for analgesic drugs, especially opiates, and a long-lasting postoperative analgesia. We have confirmed these clinical observations in rats using the tail-flick latency (TFL) test to measure pain threshold. TCES was not found to modify the pain threshold in drug-free rats, but it potentiated morphine-induced analgesia (systemic injection). To obtain a maximal effect, the stimulation must be initiated 3 h before the drug injection and be maintained throughout the duration of its pharmacological action. TCES potentitation was found to depend on the dose of the drug, the intensity of the current and the polarity of electrodes. These findings were confirmed by blind tests of the efficiency of TCES on several opiate analgesic drugs currently used in human surgery (morphine, fentanyl, alfentanil and dextromoramide). The analgesic effect of these 4 opiates (TFL as % of baseline without or with TCES) were respectively: 174%, 306%; 176%, 336%; 160%, 215%; and 267%, 392%. The results were obtained not only after systemic opiate treatment, but also after intracerebroventricular injection of morphine (10 micrograms; analgesic effect 152%, 207% with TCES) suggesting that TCES potentiation of opiate-induced analgesia is centrally mediated."

In summary, hemibody irradiation has developed as a safe, efficient technique for palliating multiple sites of symptomatic osseous metastases, which occur so often in advanced prostatic carcinoma. The rapidity, frequency, and duration of pain relief, as well as the convenience to the patient of a solitary treatment to multiple symptomatic areas simultaneously, make this type of treatment especially appealing. By following premedication and radiation dose guidelines, both acute and delayed side effects can be kept tolerable or at a minimal incidence. Although sequential hemibody radiation has also been explored as \"systemic\" therapy, the results in prostatic carcinoma have not proved dramatic, and complications have been considerable. Hormonal therapy would certainly seem to be less life-threatening and equally beneficial according to present data.

    "abstract": "Pathogenesis and pathophysiology of meningitis. Advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of meningitis have occurred primarily through the use of experimental animal models. These models have proven to be particularly valuable in experimental bacterial meningitis, focusing on the bacterial virulence factors responsible for the initiation of infections, CNS invasion, and induction of SAS inflammation. Recent studies have examined the formation of host inflammatory cytokines in response to these virulence factors. These cytokines may be responsible for many of the pathophysiologic consequences of bacterial meningitis (eg. increased BBB permeability, cerebral edema, and increased intracranial pressure). Meningitis due to C. neoformans occurs most commonly in patients with defects in cell-mediated immunity (eg, AIDS), and the depletion of T helper cells in AIDS patients may allow unrestricted cryptococcal growth. Viral meningitis is an illness of low prevalence when compared with the overall occurrence of viral infections at other sites. CNS infection usually occurs by means of traversal across barriers that normally exclude viral invasion of the CNS, primarily through hematogenous dissemination from initial sites of infection. These advances in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of bacterial, fungal, and viral meningitis may lead to the development of innovative treatment strategies for these disorders."

Norepinephrine (NE) concentrations were measured in 15 discrete areas of the central nervous system of two types of genetically epilepsy-prone rats (GEPRs) and in nonepileptic controls. Both moderate-seizure (GEPR-3) and severe-seizure (GEPR-9) animals had extensive abnormalities in brain NE concentration. Deficits of equal magnitude in GEPR-3s and GEPR-9s were found in the spinal cord, midbrain minus the inferior colliculus, inferior colliculus, hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, occipital + parietal cortex, frontal cortex, and olfactory septum. Because both types of GEPRs share these deficits and share seizure susceptibility, we hypothesize that these areas are candidates for regulation of seizure susceptibility in GEPRs. In addition, because GEPR-9s have more severe seizures than GEPR-3s and because GEPR-9s had greater NE deficits in several brain areas (cerebellum, pons-medulla, thalamus, and possibly the temporal cortex and olfactory bulbs), we hypothesize that these areas may be important in regulation of seizure severity in GEPRs. All animals used in these experiments had been protected from seizure-provoking stimuli and were naive to seizures. Because the abnormalities in NE concentration were present in seizure-predisposed animals that were protected from seizures, we conclude that these abnormalities are important components of the seizure-predisposition characteristic of GEPRs and do not result from seizure experience."

OBJECTIVE: The relation of poor health to the onset of depression symptoms in late life is well recognized, but little attention has been given to characteristics that might predict persistence or remission of depressive symptoms. In previous analyses the authors found that increasing disability and declining health preceded the emergence of depressive symptoms in older community residents and accounted for 70% of the variance explained by discriminant analyses. The aim of the present analysis was to examine the relevance of changes in health and disability to the persistence of depressive symptoms. METHOD: A representative sample of 1,855 adults aged 65 or older were assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale at baseline. Twenty-four months later, 1,577 individuals were available for a second assessment of depressive symptoms. The characteristics of the 97 community residents whose depressive symptoms persisted over 24 months were compared to those of the 114 whose symptoms remitted. RESULTS: Changes in health, differences in age, sleep disturbance, and added formal support services accounted for more than 30% of the variance between the persistently depressed and remission groups. Advanced age and worsening health were associated with persistent symptoms, improved health with remission. CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have indicated that untoward changes in health and disability play a major role in the onset of depressive symptoms. These findings show a substantial contribution to chronicity as well."

Myelography demonstrated 51 completely avulsed roots (78%) and 14 incompletely avulsed roots (22%). A traumatic meningocele was detected at 38 roots on myelograms and 51 roots on CT myelograms.

The normal isoform of hamster and human scrapie amyloid precursor protein was found on the microsomal/synaptosomal membranes anchored solely by the C-terminal glycolipid. Glycolipid cleavage resulted in dissociation from the membranes and change of behavior from a highly hydrophobic to a hydrophilic protein, susceptible to proteases.

A part of PrPSc/CJD was released from the membranes after prolonged trypsin treatment, yielding a further protease-resistant product of 27-30 kDa. The results demonstrate the proteolytic resistance of the membrane-bound PrPSc/CJD isoform and also indicate the presence of a different, apparently disease-induced mechanism of membrane interaction in the scrapie- and CJD-infected microsomal and synaptosomal membranes."

Cross-reactive idiotopes are a possible target for therapeutical interventions in autoimmune diseases. To investigate their role in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) we analyzed the Id of rat anti-AChR mAb 6, 35, 61, 65 and a control myeloma protein IR27. Anti-Id 6, 35, 61, 65 bound in a direct binding assay with various affinity to all rat anti-AChR mAb that were tested. Anti-Id IR27 recognized none of the anti-AChR mAb. The specificity of these crossreactions was confirmed by inhibition studies with anti-AChR mAb and two control rat myeloma proteins (IR27 and IR241). In addition, the Id expression on mAb D6, a mouse anti-human AChR mAb was recognized by anti-Id 6, 35, and 65. Anti-Id, except anti-Id IR27, bound to affinity purified IgG from the sera of rats with EAMG, but not to preimmune Lewis IgG. These results suggest extensive sharing of idiotopes among anti-AChR mAb, which are also present in EAMG serum. Anti-AChR mAb against the main immunogenic region (6, 35, 65) from different rat strains, shared at least one paratope-related cross-reactive idiotopes. In the view of the fact that anti-main immunogenic region antibodies might form a predominant fraction of the polyclonal response against AChR, it is conceivable that an anti-Id recognizing these antibodies could have therapeutical applications as for example a selective immune absorbent or in immunotoxin therapy."

To determine the true incidence of abnormalities in bone marrow specimens from patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the clinical significance of these abnormalities regarding their cause and their role in the production of hematologic complications, 216 bone marrow biopsies, aspirates, and/or imprint preparations from 178 patients who either were seropositive for HIV infection or met the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were studied. Detailed morphologic review was performed in a blind fashion as to clinical status. Extensive clinical, therapeutic, and laboratory data were collected for each patient. Statistical analysis was performed to detect significant correlations between morphologic findings and clinical/therapeutic/laboratory features. Among the most common bone marrow findings were hypercellularity (53% of specimens), myelodysplasia (69%), evidence of reticuloendothelial (RE) iron blockade (65%), megaloblastic hematopoiesis (38%), fibrosis (20%), plasmacytosis (25%), lymphocytic aggregates (36%), and granulomas (13%). A number of statistically significant correlations between morphologic findings and clinical features were noted. No significant association was detected between any morphologic finding and therapy with a variety of drugs. In 7 of 14 (50%) patients found to have marrow involvement by malignant neoplasm, the bone marrow represented the initial site of diagnosis of the neoplasm. Most of the bone marrow abnormalities associated with HIV infection appear to be related directly to the infection or its complications and not to therapeutic intervention. In certain clinical situations, bone marrow examination continues to be useful in the management of patients infected with HIV."

Neuropsychological test performances of 82 subjects and of a noninjured control group were analyzed by two principal components analyses (PCAs). Each PCA extracted 15 factors relating to a range of cognitive impairments, as well as neuropsychological features consistent with posttraumatic personality changes. Measures identified by the PCAs were applied to 85 head-injured subjects in the series to examine the incidence of impairment in four neuropsychological areas: disorders of learning and memory, neuropsychological features consistent with posttraumatic personality change, slowness in rate of information processing, and a range of basic neuropsychological skills. Overall, impairments occurred in 70% of the series. Disorders of learning and memory were the most common type of deficit (56.5%), with disturbances in basic neuropsychological skills the least frequent (16.5%). Variability among subjects with respect to the types and combinations of neuropsychological impairments was a characteristic feature of this clinical group, but the largest proportion (one-third) demonstrated isolated impairments. The implications of the incidence and selectivity of neuropsychological impairments are discussed."

Impaired cognitive functioning impedes the development of age-appropriate adaptive behavior, thus adding to the burdens of many children with epilepsy. Detailed neuropsychological assessment can identify the underlying ability-related impairments that contribute to the adaptive behavior deficiencies evidenced, particularly in the home and school settings. This information can serve as the basis for a multidisciplinary treatment plan tailored to individual needs. Ideally, the need for such a treatment plan should be perceived early in childhood, so that it can be developed and applied preventively.

The presence of individual keratin polypeptides and desmoplakins was immunohistochemically studied in 25 spindle cell sarcomas of different types using acetone-fixed frozen sections. Results revealed that keratins 8 and 18 were present in a high number of tumors: 9 of 9 synovial sarcomas, 5 of 7 leiomyosarcomas, 5 of 5 malignant schwannomas, and 1 of 4 undifferentiated spindle cell sarcomas. In addition to keratins 8 and 18, the glandular component of synovial sarcoma showed prominent reactivity with antibodies to keratins 7 and 19. Also the glandular epithelial cells in synovial sarcoma showed desmoplakin immunoreactivity preferentially in a luminal distribution, but desmoplakin was absent in other spindle cell sarcomas. Furthermore keratin 13 was seen focally in 4 of 9 synovial sarcomas. In contrast, keratins 7, 13, and 19 were practically absent in leiomyosarcomas, malignant schwannomas, and undifferentiated spindle cell sarcomas. The widespread presence of keratins 8 and 18 in various spindle cell sarcomas may reflect aberrant keratin expression in mesenchymal cells, previously described in cultured transformed fibroblasts. The presence of keratins 7 and 19 and desmoplakin is highly associated with morphologically observable epithelial differentiation restricted to synovial sarcoma among spindle cell sarcomas."

During an 18-month period in a pediatric intensive care unit, nine patients with vocal cord paralysis were identified using flexible bronchoscopy. When tracheally extubated, each child was found to have stridor. The children ranged in age from 17 days to 5 1/2 years. Two patients had unilateral paralysis, but neither required tracheostomy. Seven patients displayed bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis. Of these, six patients required tracheostomy. Surgical injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve was the probable cause in two patients. The other seven patients had neurologic disorders with documented or suspected increases of intracranial pressure. Four of the seven patients with bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis regained cord mobility within 4 months. Both children with unilateral cord paralysis have no stridor and vocalize well 1 year later. Cord paralysis in the setting of intracranial hypertension probably results from compression or ischemia of the vagus nerve before it exits the skull. Early visualization of the larynx should be done in patients who become stridulous when extubated, especially those with prior thoracic procedures or with neurologic disorders associated with intracranial hypertension."

(2) What are the correlates of school difficulty? (3) Are behavior problems associated with school difficulty when variables are controlled for these correlates? The analysis revealed that 34% of very low birth weight children could be characterized as having school difficulty, compared with 20% and 14% of the other groups, respectively, and that they were more likely to have higher scores on the hyperactive subscale of the Behavior Problems Index. Although a broad array of sociodemographic factors correlated with school difficulty, very low birth weight and hyperactivity scores contributed independently to the risk of academic problems. We conclude that very low birth weight infants are at risk of having school problems that are in part associated with hyperactive behavior."

Identification of an immunodominant T cell determinant on the N-terminal end of the VP2 capsid protein in susceptible SJL/J mice. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelinating disease serves as a relevant animal model of human multiple sclerosis. Myelin damage induced by TMEV infection appears to be immune mediated. Disease susceptibility correlates best with the temporal development of chronic, high levels of TMEV-specific, MHC class II-restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses. We have proposed a model wherein these responses result in CNS demyelination via a macrophage-mediated terminal nonspecific bystander response. As virus-specific DTH responses appear to be intimately involved in the pathogenicity of CNS demyelination, it is critical to determine the specificity of these responses so that effector T cells specific for potential pathogenic epitopes can be targeted to serve as the focus of specific immunoregulatory processes. In the current study, the capsid protein specificity of the TMEV-susceptible SJL/J and TMEV-resistant C57BL/6 mouse strains was examined. DTH and Tprlf responses in both infected and immunized SJL/J mice were found to be predominantly directed toward the VP2 capsid protein, specifically to an epitope(s) contained within the N-terminal 150 amino acids of VP2. This same epitope was also found to be dominant in priming SJL/J mice for responses to challenge with intact virions. In contrast, the T cell-mediated responses of TMEV-resistant C57BL/6 mice did not show preferential reactivity towards VP2, because all three major capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, and VP3) elicited responses with essentially equal potency. The relationship of the restricted VP2 T cell epitope to predicted neutralizing antibody sites on the VP2 protein is discussed as is the potential use of this epitope for prevention and/or treatment of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease via the induction of epitope-specific tolerance."

    "abstract": "Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine and serious neurologic illness: an updated review of the epidemiologic evidence. A widespread impression that DTP vaccine does cause brain damage has been based first on historical precedent--smallpox and rabies vaccines were recognized as sometimes causing devastating neurologic illness; analogy to pertussis--the disease can cause encephalopathy; and more recently on anecdotal evidence, particularly case series. A noncausal relationship--coincidence--could explain the temporal relation between DTP vaccine and neurologic illness, inasmuch as DTP vaccine is given at the age of emergence of idiopathic neurologic disease. The relationship between DTP vaccine and neurologic illness lacks specificity. Case series have had an impact on both physicians' and the lay public's impression of the safety of pertussis vaccine greatly out of proportion to their scientific importance. Case series can be useful for generating hypotheses but cannot provide evidence that pertussis vaccine is causally related to acute neurologic illness or brain damage. Observational studies using cohort and ecologic designs did not find an association between DTP vaccine and serious neurologic illness, but they were not powerful enough to detect an association as rare as that observed by the NCES investigators. The case-control design offers the best chance of providing causal evidence regarding DTP vaccine and serious neurologic illness. The NCES is the only published case-control study of this issue. This study found a rare association between DTP vaccine and some types of acute neurologic illness. Bias and chance are unlikely to account entirely for the association demonstrated by the NCES. However, the association has not yet been replicated by other case-control studies. The NCES does not demonstrate that DTP vaccine causes permanent brain damage."

Systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus are the most commonly associated medical problems. Occlusion of the posterior ciliary arterial blood supply to the retrolaminar optic nerve leads to axoplasmic stasis and further compromise of vessels in the nerve substance, which causes the typical funduscopic appearance. Although there is no recognized medical treatment that can reverse the visual loss, a recent report suggests optic nerve sheath decompression for a select group of patients with a gradual decline in vision due to ION may be beneficial. When ION occurs in persons less than 50 years of age, such etiologies as juvenile diabetes mellitus, antiphospholipid antibody-associated clotting disorders, collagen-vascular disease, and migraines should be considered. Rarely, complications of intraocular surgery or acute blood loss may cause an ischemic event in the optic nerve."

A severe visual recognition deficit was accompanied by impairments in discriminating shape, reflectance, and orientation, although visual acuity and colour vision, along with tactile recognition and intelligence, were largely preserved. Neuropsychological and behavioural investigations have indicated that the patient is able to utilize visual pattern information surprisingly well for the control of hand movements during reaching, and can even read many whole words, despite being unable to make simple discriminative judgements of shape or orientation. She seems to have no awareness of shape primitives through Gestalt grouping by similarity, continuity or symmetry. It is proposed that many of these perceptual disorders might be the combined result of (1) a selective loss of the cortical elaboration of the magnocellular visual processing stream, and (2) a selective output disconnection from a central processor of visual boundaries and shape primitives in the occipital cortex."

As surgical treatments for adult and pediatric forms of epilepsy have become more refined, methods for noninvasive localization of epileptogenic foci have become increasingly important. Detection of focal brain metabolic or flow abnormalities is now well recognized as an essential step in the presurgical evaluation of many patients with epilepsy. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is most beneficial when used in the context of the total clinical evaluation of patients, including scalp EEG, invasive EEG, neuropsychologic testing, etc. Metabolic PET studies also give insight into pathophysiologic mechanisms of epilepsy. The dynamic nature of the interictal hypometabolism observed with 18[F]FDG in some patients suggests that excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters and their receptors may be involved. An exciting current application of PET scanning is the use of tracers for neurotransmitter receptors in the study of epilepsy patients. Mu and non-mu opiate receptors have been extensively studied and are beginning to give new insights into this disorder. Increased labeling of mu receptors in temporal neocortex using 11C-carfentanil has been demonstrated and, in some patients, supplements the clinical localization information from 18[F]FDG studies. Increased mu opiate receptor number or affinity is thought to play a role in anticonvulsant mechanisms. Specificity of increased mu receptors is supported by the absence of significant changes in non-mu opiate receptors. Other brain receptors are also of interest for future studies, particularly those for excitatory neurotransmitters. Combined studies of flow, metabolism, and neuroreceptors may elucidate the factors responsible for initiation and termination of seizures, thus improving patient treatment."

Exclusionary criteria for all groups included cerebrovascular risk factors. All subjects had Hachinski Ischemic Index scores of less than 2 and computed tomographic scans showing no infarct. The WMHIs were classified as periventricular WMHIs or deep WMHIs and graded 0 through 3 (0 indicated absent, and 3, severe). For the group with DAT and older control subjects, periventricular WMHIs and deep WMHIs were graded 2 or 3 in fewer than 17% and 27% of subjects, respectively, whereas in the younger control subjects, all ratings were grade 1 or less. Serum cholesterol and systolic blood pressure values, although within the normal range, were elevated significantly in older control subjects when compared with those in younger control subjects. No significant differences in WMHI ratings, blood pressure, cholesterol, or triglyceride levels were found between patients with DAT and age-matched control subjects. Systolic blood pressure levels correlated with the severity of periventricular WMHIs only in older control subjects. Age correlated with periventricular WMHIs and deep WMHIs within both the older control subjects and the patients with DAT. There was no significant correlation between WMHIs and the severity of dementia in the group with DAT. These results suggest that, in subjects screened for cerebrovascular risk factors, WMHIs are rare and occur with identical frequency in patients with DAT as in age-matched healthy control subjects."

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of quinidine and mexiletine on the adaptation of ventricular refractoriness to a change in heart rate. The ventricular effective refractory period was measured at a basic drive cycle length of 500 msec with basic drive train durations of two beats, eight beats, 20 beats and 3 minutes. The ventricular refractory periods were measured in the baseline state and after oral treatment with quinidine or mexiletine in 20 subjects each. In the baseline state, there was progressive shortening of the ventricular refractory period as the drive train duration increased from two beats to 3 minutes. Quinidine prolonged refractoriness by 5% (p less than 0.001) at each drive train duration. Mexiletine did not affect the ventricular effective refractory period at any of the drive train durations. In a control group of 20 subjects, there were no significant differences between two determinations of refractoriness at each basic drive train duration. In conclusion, neither quinidine nor mexiletine affect the adaptation of ventricular refractoriness to an increase in rate. Although the ventricular effective refractory period measured with a conventional basic drive train duration of eight beats is often more than 20 msec longer than the actual ventricular effective refractory period measured with a drive train duration of 3 minutes, the effects of quinidine and mexiletine on the conventionally measured ventricular effective refractory period accurately reflect the effects of these drugs on the actual ventricular effective refractory period."

According to DSM-III-R criteria, the postictal psychosis resembled an organic delusional syndrome which was paranoid in 7 and schizophreniform in 1 and an organic mood syndrome in 1. A high incidence of ictal fear, of bilateral independent epileptogenic discharge, and of small foreign tissue lesion were unexpected findings and appeared to represent risk factors, especially in patients otherwise handicapped by an epileptic personality disorder. Recognition of postictal psychosis in this setting and in others is important both prognostically and therapeutically.

Although selective posterior rhizotomy has become an increasingly utilized surgical treatment for spasticity, the procedure is unstandardized and is performed differently at various medical centers. Most surgeons use some form of direct dorsal rootlet stimulation with intraoperative multichannel electromyographic response monitoring. Electrophysiological monitoring offers the theoretical advantage of identifying pathologic reflex circuits for interruption while preserving those pathways that are \"normal.\" However, the monitoring technique most commonly used has not been critically evaluated and, therefore, its value remains uncertain. In 22 selective posterior rhizotomy procedures performed for spastic cerebral palsy, the authors were unable to identify a single electromyographic response that could be called normal by presently accepted criteria. Dorsal rootlets were chosen for division on the basis of relative degrees of abnormality. Intraoperative electromyographic monitoring of a nonspastic patient produced tracings suggestive of spasticity by presently accepted criteria. These discrepancies suggest that current electrophysiological monitoring in selective posterior rhizotomy should be reevaluated."

Results indicate that the majority of physicians provided history taking, physical examination, and neurological examination.

The relation between the presence of calcified plaques in the thoracic aorta, as detected on chest x-rays, and the development of cardiovascular disease is examined during 12 years of follow-up of the Framingham cohort (n = 5,209). The prevalence of aortic calcified plaques approximately doubled with each decade of age, with only a trivial male predominance. Its presence was associated with a twofold increase in risk of cardiovascular death in men and women younger than age 65, even after other risk factors were taken into account. Similar increases in risk were found for coronary artery disease, stroke and intermittent claudication among middle-aged women. In middle-aged men these risks were less marked. The predictive value of aortic calcified plaques generally diminished with age. Risk of sudden coronary death in men with calcified plaques in the thoracic aorta ranged from a sevenfold increase at age 35 to no excess risk at age 70 years. These results support the view that atherosclerosis is a generalized process. The finding of aortic calcified plaques in a relatively young subject on a routine chest x-ray should be regarded as a sign for potential development of clinically manifest atherosclerotic disease in the cardiac, cerebral and peripheral arterial circulation."

    "abstract": "Limitations of electroencephalographic monitoring in the detection of cerebral ischemia accompanying carotid endarterectomy. An analysis was undertaken of 458 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed over 6 years with the patient under general anesthesia and with electroencephalographic monitoring. Seventy patients (15%) had electroencephalographic changes suggestive of ischemia with carotid clamping and had shunts placed. Ischemic encephalographic changes occurred in 26% of patients with an occluded contralateral carotid artery, 21% of patients with a prior stroke history, and 12% of patients with no stroke history and a patent contralateral carotid artery. Nineteen strokes (4.1%), nine transient deficits (2.0%), and one death (0.2%) occurred in the 458 endarterectomies in this experience. Ten of the 19 strokes and five of nine transient deficits were immediately apparent when patients awoke from anesthesia. Five of 10 patients with immediate strokes and all five patients with immediate transient deficits had no ischemic electroencephalographic changes during the procedure. Two other patients with immediate strokes initially had ischemic electroencephalographic changes after carotid clamping that reversed with increased blood pressure or shunting. Therefore 7 of 10 patients with immediate strokes and all 5 patients with immediate transient deficits had electroencephalographs unchanged from baseline at completion of the procedure, and thus deficits not manifest by operative electroencephalographic changes developed. Our data do not support the tenet that electroencephalographic monitoring will always predict neurologic deficits accompanying carotid endarterectomy."

Trichothiodystrophy is a feature of several diseases that consist of characteristic hair shaft abnormalities and a wide spectrum of other developmental defects. Detection of sulfur-deficient hairs identifies this disorder and separates it from other similar ectodermal dysplasias with normal sulfur content. Detection of low sulfur hair syndrome is also important for genetic counseling, because the disease appears to be an autosomal recessive trait. We report a patient with chronic neutropenia, mild mental retardation, and low sulfur content in hair. Our case expands the spectrum of disorders associated with trichothiodystrophy."

Transitory cerebral ischaemic attack provoked by carotid sinus reflex The association of internal carotid stenosis with the carotid sinus syndrome represents a special clinical entity. Transitory cerebral ischaemic attack (TIA) will usually be manifested by activation of carotid sinus reflex. Eighteen patients were observed suffering from both carotid sinus hypersensitivity and TIA. The patients had had TIA's for many years. Unilateral internal carotid stenosis was detected in 15 cases, while 3 patients had bilateral carotid stenosis. On carotid sinus stimulation, syncope appeared and a TIA could be provoked. The mean duration of the syncopic attack was 5500 ms and was based on sinus arrest in 14 cases and on third degree AV block in 4 cases. In all patients carotid artery disobliteration was performed; in 14 patients pacemaker implantation was necessary, while 4 patients could be treated by atropine medication. The development of a TIA could be abolished in every patient and 14 patients remained totally symptom free."

Inhalation anesthesia first with halothane followed by enflurane relieved a patient with status asthmaticus who was refractory to conventional therapy including mechanical ventilation. After 13 days of anesthesia while on mechanical ventilation and employing nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, significant neuromuscular impairment, manifested by tetraplegia and sensory disturbance, developed. Anesthesia was discontinued on day 14, and the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation on day 16. Over the next two months, the neuromuscular impairment markedly improved. Halothane was associated with cardiac arrhythmias and hepatitis necessitating replacement by enflurane. Enflurane appeared to be as effective a treatment for refractory asthma as halothane. The most probable cause of the neuromuscular impairment in our patient was the long-term use of inhalation anesthetics or nondepolarizing muscle relaxants."

The components of protein phosphorylation systems (protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and their phosphoprotein substrates) are highly enriched in neuronal cells compared with other cell types. We exploited this relative neuronal enrichment of protein phosphorylation system components to develop a general assay technique for putative protein kinase substrates (phosphoproteins) in human cerebrospinal fluid. Using this cerebrospinal fluid phosphoprotein assay, we have detected a putative protein kinase C substrate protein of apparent Mr 60 kd in 6 of 14 patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration but not in any of 55 patients with a variety of other neurological diseases. Phosphoproteins in cerebrospinal fluid may provide novel and unique markers for the diagnosis or staging of neuronal diseases as well as offer potential insights into the biochemical characterization of affected neuronal populations."

    "abstract": "Clinoidal meningiomas. Anterior clinoidal meningiomas are frequently grouped with suprasellar or sphenoid ridge meningiomas, masking their notorious association with a high mortality and morbidity rate, failure of total removal, and recurrence. To avoid injury to encased cerebral vessels, most surgeons are content with subtotal removal. Without total removal, however, recurrence is expected. Recent advances in cranial-base exposure and cavernous sinus surgery have facilitated radical total removal. The author reports 24 cases operated on with vigorous attempts at total removal of the tumor with involved dura and bone. This experience has distinguished three groups (I, II, and III) which influence surgical difficulties, the success of total removal, and outcome. These subgroups relate to the presence of interfacing arachnoid membranes between the tumor and cerebral vessels. The presence or absence of arachnoid membranes depends on the origin of the tumor and its relation to the naked segment of carotid artery lying outside the carotid cistern. Total removal was impossible in the three patients in Group I, with postoperative death occurring in one patient and hemiplegia in another. Total removal was achieved in 18 of the 19 patients in Group II, with one death from pulmonary embolism. In the two patients in Group III, total removal without complications was easily achieved."

Mutations at the mouse dwarf locus (dw) interrupt the normal development of the anterior pituitary gland, resulting in the loss of expression of growth hormone, prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone, and hypoplasia of their respective cell types. Disruptions in the gene encoding the POU-domain transcription factor, Pit-1, occur in both characterized alleles of the dwarf locus. The data indicate that Pit-1 is necessary for the specification of the phenotype of three cell types in the anterior pituitary, and directly link a transcription factor to commitment and progression events in mammalian organogenesis."

The aim was to determine whether behavioural reactions of cry and facial activity provoked by an invasive procedure could be discriminated from responses to non-invasive tactile events. Thirty-six healthy full-term infants (mean age 2.2 h) received 3 procedures in counterbalanced order: intramuscular injection, application of triple dye to the umbilical stub, and rubbing thigh with alcohol. Significant effects of procedure were found for total face activity and latency to face movement. A cluster of facial actions comprised of brow bulging, eyes squeezed shut, deepening of the naso-labial furrow and open mouth was associated most frequently with the invasive procedure. Comparisons between the 2 non-invasive procedures showed more facial activity to thigh swabbing and least to application of triple dye to the umbilical cord. Acoustic analysis of cry showed statistically significant differences across procedures only for latency to cry and cry duration for the group as a whole. However, babies who cried to two procedures showed higher pitch and greater intensity to the injection. There were no significant differences in melody, dysphonation, or jitter. Methodological difficulties for investigators in this area were examined, including criteria for the selection of cries for analysis, and the logical and statistical challenges of contrasting cries induced by different conditions when some babies do not always cry. It was concluded that facial expression, in combination with short latency to onset of cry and long duration of first cry cycle typifies reaction to acute invasive procedures."

The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of graded exercise testing of mentally retarded adolescents and adults. The testing was conducted at two geographically different centers. At Center A, 14 mentally retarded adolescents (11 boys, three girls) with Down syndrome, who were educable or trainable, were recruited from a nonresidential school. The subjects completed two Balke-Ware treadmill protocols until exhaustion. The treadmill time and heart rate (HR) were recorded. The time between tests was approximately one week. At Center B, 21 mentally retarded adults (14 women, seven men means IQ = 56) were recruited from local workshops and group homes. These subjects completed a treadmill walking protocol, with metabolic measurements, until exhaustion. The time between tests varied from one to four months. At Center A, the subjects achieved a mean treadmill time of 8.72min on test one and 8.84min on test two (means HR = 174 and 175bpm, respectively). The reliability coefficient between the two tests was .94. At Center B, the subjects achieved a mean V0(2)max of 27.2mL.kg-1.min-1 on test one and 26.9mL.kg-1.min-1 on test two. The reliability coefficient was .93. These data show that maximal exercise testing is reliable for these populations of mentally retarded individuals, exhibiting similar values to their nonretarded peers."

Upright tilt-table testing has been proposed as a possible way to test for vasovagal episodes. This study investigated the clinical utility of this technique in the evaluation and management of patients with syncope of unknown origin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with recurrent unexplained syncope and six control subjects were evaluated by use of an upright tilt-table test for 30 minutes, with or without an infusion of isoproterenol (1 to 3 micrograms/minute given intravenously), in an attempt to provoke bradycardia, hypotension, or both. Of the 25 patients, there were 14 males and 11 females, with a mean age of 50 +/- 16 years. Six control patients with no history of syncope were also studied. All tilt-positive patients received therapy with either beta-blockers, disopyramide, transdermal scopolamine, or hydroflurocortisone, the efficacy of which was evaluated by another tilt-table test. RESULTS: Syncope occurred in six patients (24%) during the baseline tilt and in nine patients (36%) during isoproterenol infusion (total positives, 60%). None of the controls had syncope during the test. All patients who had positive test results eventually became tilt-table-negative by therapy, and over a mean follow-up period of 16 +/- 2 months no further episodes have occurred. CONCLUSION: From this study we conclude that upright tilt-table testing combined with isoproterenol infusion is clinically useful in the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope and the evaluation of pharmacologic therapy."

Multimodality evoked potential (MEP) testing, including brainstem auditory, visual, and somatosensory evoked potentials, have been reported to be useful in predicting outcome in severe closed head injury. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials have been demonstrated to be abnormal in 10% to 40% of acute mild head injury. A prospective study of 18 patients with mild closed head injury was undertaken to determine the usefulness of MEP screening within two weeks of the acute event. Long latency event-related potentials (P300s), in response to auditory stimuli with an oddball paradigm, were included in the screening. The subjects had several symptoms consistent with the postconcussive syndrome at the time of the evoked potential testing. Only one patient had an abnormal evoked potential response (greater than three standard deviations from the mean) from all the testing done. The standard methods of MEP testing were insensitive to quantifying the possible physiologic changes that are associated with memory deficits, lethargy, and emotional irritability after mild closed head injury."

    "abstract": "Development and reversal of contingent inefficacy and tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of carbamazepine. The relationship of the timing of drug administration to anticonvulsant efficacy against amygdala kindled seizures was studied. During kindling development, rats received carbamazepine (CBZ, 15mg/kg) before (CBZ-before) or after each amygdala stimulation (CBZ-after). After kindling to full seizures, when all animals were given CBZ before the stimulation, only the CBZ-after group showed a good anticonvulsant response. The rats that had received CBZ before (during development of kindled seizures) remained unresponsive to CBZ treatment (contingent inefficacy). When drug-naive or CBZ-after animals repeatedly received CBZ before electrical stimulation, they developed tolerance to its anticonvulsant effects (contingent tolerance). The tolerance could be reversed by a period of treatment with CBZ-after or by kindling the animal drug-free, but not by CBZ administration alone or by time off from both drug and seizures. These findings suggest that inefficacy and tolerance to CBZ may be affected by the temporal contingencies of drug administration and that responsiveness can be reinstated by altering these contingencies."

Hypertonic saline resuscitation was compared to isotonic fluid resuscitation in a large animal model combining hemorrhagic shock with head injury. Sheep were subjected to a freeze injury of one cerebral hemisphere as well as 2 hours of hypotension at a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 mm Hg. Resuscitation was then carried out (MAP = 80 mm Hg) for 1 hour with either lactated Ringer's (LR, n = 6) or 7.5% hypertonic saline (HS, n = 6). Hemodynamic parameters and intracranial pressure (ICP) were followed. At the end of resuscitation brain water content was determined in injured and uninjured hemispheres. No differences were detected in cardiovascular parameters; however, ICPs were lower in animals resuscitated with HS (4.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) compared to LR (15.2 +/- 2.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Additionally, brain water content (ml H2O/gm dry weight) in uninjured brain hemispheres was lower after HS resuscitation (HS = 3.3 +/- 0.1; LR = 4.0 +/- 0.1; p less than 0.05). No differences were detected in the injured hemispheres. We conclude that hypertonic saline abolishes increases in ICP seen during resuscitation in a model combining hemorrhagic shock with brain injury by dehydrating areas where the blood-brain barrier is still intact. Hypertonic saline may prove useful in the early management of multiple trauma patients."

Regional cortical cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and intracranial pressure (ICP) were monitored continuously with a combined thermal diffusion probe/ICP monitor in 12 patients (8 men and 4 women; mean age, 31 years; range, 7-65 years) with acute head injuries. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission was 6 (range, 4-12). The rCBF/ICP probes were placed during surgical procedures (n = 11) or in an intensive care unit (n = 1) for subdural hematomas (n = 7), cerebral contusions (n = 4), and an epidural hematoma (n = 1). No probe-related complications occurred. Reduced CBF often occurred and was often inversely proportional to elevations in ICP. Posttraumatic cerebral arterial vasospasm in one patient was detected by rCBF monitoring and confirmed by angiography. In 6 patients who progressed to brain death, rCBF patterns disappeared, which correlated with their clinical and electroencephalographic examinations. Several patients with severe, diffuse brain injuries and high ICP had hyperemic rCBF patterns. In 2 of these patients, increases in rCBF preceded rises in ICP, which implied loss of autoregulation as a mechanism in the development of malignant cerebral edema. This method of CBF monitoring has not yet been established for clinical decision making. The early detection of ischemic or hyperemic responses by continuous CBF monitoring could hasten intervention aimed at restoring adequate tissue perfusion. The technique could also serve as an index of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and is suitable to gain more insight into the pathophysiology of head injury, especially the relationship of CBF to ICP."

Cervical motor roots and the brachial plexus were excited transcutaneously with magnetic (MagStim) and electrical stimulation (ElStim) applied dorsally over the spine and over the supraclavicular fossa (Erb's point). The compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) from the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) and the biceps muscles (BICEPS) could be evoked with either stimulating technique in all 52 subjects tested. With MagStim over the spinous process C7, greater CMAPs were obtained from ADM (p less than or equal to 0.0001, paired t test) and BICEPS (p less than or equal to 0.005) when the inducing current in the coil as viewed from behind was clockwise for the right arm and vice versa. ElStim with the cathode over C7/T1 and the anode directed cranially provided greater CMAPs from the ADM (p less than or equal to 0.0001) and smaller CMAPs from the BICEPS (p less than or equal to 0.01) than with the inverse polarity. MagStim of the cervical roots provided CMAPs which were smaller from ADM (p less than or equal to 0.0001), and greater from BICEPS (p less than or equal to 0.0001), than ElStim (cathode C7/T1), whereas latencies did not differ significantly (p less than or equal to 0.3). When comparing ElStim and MagStim applied over Erb's point, the former yielded greater CMAPs and 0.5 ms longer latencies from both the ADM and BICEPS (p less than or equal to 0.001). From these data and additional studies in four patients, including direct intraoperative root stimulation in one of them, it is concluded that ElStim and MagStim over the spine excite the motor roots at a similar site, that is, within a few cm outside the intervertebral foramina."

Of 165 consecutive patients undergoing computerized tomography- or magnetic resonance imaging-guided stereotactic brain biopsies at the Cleveland Clinic between June, 1987, and November, 1989, four patients (2.4%) developed arterial hemorrhage refractory to conventional efforts to secure hemostasis. Craniotomy was performed in one of these patients to control the hemorrhage; in the other three, 0.5 to 2 cc of thrombin (5000 U/cc) was slowly injected via the biopsy cannula, resulting in immediate control of bleeding in all three cases. Postoperatively, the first two patients treated with 1 to 2 cc of thrombin were slow to awaken; one had evidence of vasospasm by transcranial Doppler ultrasound studies and multiple infarcts on cranial computerized tomography, while the other had a moderate-sized frontal hematoma with intracranial hypertension. After prolonged recovery periods, only mild neurological deficits persisted in both patients. The third patient, treated with 0.5 cc of thrombin, had an uneventful postoperative course. Thrombin is highly effective for stopping intractable arterial hemorrhage during stereotactic brain biopsy; however, it is a vasospastic agent and may have been responsible for the cerebral infarctions in one patient. Therefore, thrombin should be used only as a last resort, short of craniotomy, to control intractable arterial hemorrhage during stereotactic brain biopsy."

The natural killer cell activity was significantly decreased in cirrhotic patients compared with normal controls and patients with chronic active hepatitis. Cirrhotic patients with Pugh's C grade of severity of liver disease had lower natural killer cell activity. The depression of natural killer cell activity in cirrhotic patients was inversely correlated with prothrombin time ratios, and the natural killer cell activity in cirrhotic patients with hepatic encephalopathy was lower than in patients without hepatic encephalopathy.

This report documents the disturbance in gastrointestinal motor function in a patient with selective cholinergic dysautonomia that occurred following acute infectious mononucleosis. Apart from the gut, other organs affected included the pupils, sweat glands, lacrimal and salivary glands, and urinary bladder. Autonomic function tests showed the preservation of sympathetic adrenergic functions in contrast to the generalized involvement of postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic cholinergic nerves, including denervation hypersensitivity of the pupil and urinary bladder to exogenous cholinergic agonists. Cardiac and abdominal vagal responses were abnormal. Colon myenteric plexus ganglion cells were normal by morphological and immunohistochemical studies, suggesting that the selective cholinergic dysautonomia was the most likely pathophysiologic process responsible for the observed motility disorder. This study documents the occurrence of selective cholinergic dysautonomia following a viral illness, the importance of the extrinsic neural control on the motor function of the gastrointestinal tract, and the usefulness of combined motility and autonomic function testing in the evaluation of patients with symptoms suggestive of gut dysmotility."

Thirty anesthetized cats were randomly assigned to one of three groups of 10 cats each: nimodipine treatment, nimodipine treatment combined with induced hypertension, or a control group. The behavior of the cerebral pial arteries was measured by means of microscopic observation through a cranial window. The middle cerebral artery of each cat was clipped for 1 hour via the transorbital approach. Five hours after circulation was reestablished in the middle cerebral artery, Evans blue dye was injected intravenously: 30 minutes later, the animal was killed. Administration of nimodipine or saline in the treated or control group was started 5 minutes before the middle cerebral artery was clipped and maintained until the end of the experiment. Induced hypertension was produced by administration of dopamine during the occlusion. Damage to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was judged by extravasation of Evans blue dye. Cerebral edema and infarction were evaluated from histological findings. They were most prominent in the control group: the extent of hemisphere affected was as follows (mean +/- standard error): extravasation, 40.5 +/- 8.8%; edema, 43.2 +/- 5.7%; infarction, 35.5 +/- 9.6%.

They received either no anaesthetic, 0.2 ml one per cent lidocaine plain intradermally or a ten-second spray of ethyl chloride at the cannulation site. Ethyl chloride produced skin anaesthesia that significantly reduced the pain of venepuncture. However, it was not as effective as intradermal lidocaine. It had no effect on vein visualisation or ease of cannulation. Ethyl chloride can be recommended as a method of producing instant skin anaesthesia."

The plantar hyperkeratotic skin lesion in a case of Richner-Hanhart's syndrome was investigated using ultrastructural examination. Light microscopic examination showed remarkable hyperkeratosis and some aberrant keratinocytes with multiple nuclei. On ultrastructural examination, some abnormal structures were seen in the affected keratinocytes: aggregations of tonofilaments and intracytoplasmic inclusions. The inclusions were needle shaped and were considered to be \"crystal ghosts,\" presumably of tyrosine. The formation of tyrosine crystalline inclusions seems to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of the cutaneous lesions in Richner-Hanhart's syndrome."

    "abstract": "Natural history of progressive ischemic stroke in a population treated with heparin Data on the acute natural history of progressive stroke with or without heparin treatment are limited. To define the acute course of patients treated with heparin for progressive stroke, we examined the charts of 69 such patients identified through the Cornell Neurology Database from October 1979 to June 1985. Analysis included determining whether further clinical deterioration or hemorrhagic complications were associated with readily identifiable clinical or laboratory variables. Twenty-five patients (36%) continued to deteriorate while receiving heparin, another two (3%) worsened due to intracerebral hemorrhage, and a total of 10 patients (14%) had bleeding complications. No clinical features or heparin dosing regimens distinguished the patients likely to benefit from heparin. Clinical progression or hemorrhage did not correlate with the level of anticoagulation as measured by the average heparin dose per day or the mean partial thromboplastin time. Without unequivocal evidence demonstrating heparin's ineffectiveness for progressive stroke, many clinicians managing such patients will continue to use heparin. Our results suggest that this decision should not be governed by such clinical features as a patient's age or sex or by the vascular distribution of the stroke. Furthermore, frequent measurement of and overzealous efforts to adjust the partial thromboplastin time may be unnecessary since it does not correlate with outcome."

In a study sample consisting of 388 unselected, consecutive acute stroke patients, 27 with systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 200 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 115 mmHg were compared with the other 361 patients. The patients with high blood pressure were younger (65 vs. 73 years) and much more often had a history of hypertension (78 vs. 42%). Cardiac and vascular hypertensive manifestations were more frequent, particularly when only those patients with a history of hypertension were compared in the two groups. Alcohol abuse was mentioned in a higher proportion of hypertensives in the summaries of their medical records. No definite conclusions could be drawn with regard to the size and location of the brain lesions. Clinical symptoms did not differ between the groups, neither did the proportion of patients who could be discharged from hospital immediately. Mortality was higher in the high blood pressure group (30 vs. 14%, P less than 0.05). Thus the characteristics of patients with very high blood pressure were: younger age, much more frequent and severe previous hypertension. Alcohol abuse might be an important factor. The type, size and location of the brain lesion itself could not be statistically related to the high blood pressure, but very large lesions, particularly haemorrhages, might be associated with a reactive blood pressure response."

A Dacron pouch has been developed which may prevent these problems. To assess the efficacy of the pouch, we measured various factors of pacemaker mobility in 100 patients after long-term follow-up. The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of their dictated operative reports: group 1, no pouch or anchoring stitch; group 2, pouch only; group 3, anchoring stitch to pacemaker header or pouch. The average age of the study population was 74.3 +/- 11 years. Total follow-up time was 42 +/- 28 months (group I, 53 +/- 32 months; group 2, 36 +/- 23 months; group 3, 34 +/- 25 months). There were no significant differences when pacemakers were measured for movement in the inferosuperior and lateromedial directions, nor was there any difference in the distance between the incision scar and the pacemaker header in any group. There was a significant difference between group 1 and groups 2 and 3 when the degree of tilt of the pacemaker off the chest wall was compared. This was 46 degrees +/- 34 degrees for group 1 and 27 degrees +/- 26 degrees and 26 degrees +/- 27 degrees for groups 2 and 3, respectively (p less than 0.02 for both). These data suggest that the Dacron pouch does not restrict pacemaker mobility parallel to the chest wall during long-term follow-up but does reduce the angle to which the pacemaker can be tilted relative to the chest wall."

Dopa-responsive dystonia is a clinical variant of idiopathic torsion dystonia that is distinguished from other forms of dystonia by the frequent occurrence of parkinsonism, diurnal fluctuation of symptoms, and its dramatic therapeutic response to L-dopa. Linkage of a gene causing classic dystonia in a large non-Jewish kindred (DYT1) and in a group of Ashkenazi Jewish families, to the gelsolin (GSN) and arginino-succinate synthetase (ASS) loci on chromosome 9q32-34, respectively, was recently determined. Here we report the discovery of a highly informative (GT)n repeat VNTR polymorphism within the ASS locus. Analysis of a large kindred with dopa-responsive dystonia, using this new polymorphism and conventional RFLPs for the 9q32-34 region, excludes loci in this region as a cause of this form of dystonia. This provides proof of genetic heterogeneity between classic idiopathic torsion dystonia and dopa-responsive dystonia."

    "abstract": "Compensatory mechanisms in degenerative neurologic diseases. Insights from parkinsonism. In animal models of parkinsonism, the ability to lose a substantial proportion of dopaminergic neurons without behavioral deficits does not derive from other systems taking over function of the dopaminergic pathway. The surviving nigrostriatal projection increases both the rate of synthesis and the release of dopamine, as compensatory adjustments. This capacity allows at least a fivefold rise in dopamine delivery per neuron, and this enhancement is potentiated further by receptor up-regulation. Decreased reuptake, due to loss of nerve endings, may also lead to augmented occupancy of dopamine receptors, and so constitute yet another compensatory mechanism. In humans, positron emission tomography has revealed subclinical impairment of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway in subjects at risk for parkinsonism caused by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine and Lytico-Bodig (the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-parkinsonism dementia complex of Guam). However, the separation of patients with clinically overt idiopathic parkinsonism from controls is less marked in vivo (by positron emission tomography) than in postmortem analysis (by neurochemical assay). This disparity may be attributable to the reduction in the number of nigrostriatal nerve endings, leading, in vivo, to a relative increase of extracellular dopamine because active reuptake into the nerve endings is an important mechanism for removing dopamine from the synaptic cleft. In contrast, in a postmortem setting, dopamine that is not sequestered in the storage vesicles of nerve endings is readily available for biochemical degradation during the interval between death and brain analysis. Finally, it is also possible that differences may derive, in part, from dissimilar kinetic systems for handling exogenous and endogenous levodopa."

The circulatory and thermal responses to 90 min of wheelchair ergometer exercise were examined in five wheelchair dependent (WD) women with low level spinal dysfunction and five able-bodied (AB) women who served as a comparison group. Metabolic rate during exercise was 221 W for WD and 255 W for AB (P greater than 0.05). Oral temperature (Tor), mean skin temperature (Tsk), oxygen uptake (VO2), heart rate (HR), and cardiac output (Qc) were assessed periodically throughout the exercise period. Ambient conditions were 24-25 degrees C and 38-52% relative humidity. A significant group X time interaction was found for Tor (P less than 0.001) and Tsk (P less than 0.001). Tor of the WD group steadily increased during the exercise, whereas the AB group showed a stable Tor. Tsk of WD increased rapidly during the first 5-10 min of exercise and continued to rise at a slower rate throughout the exercise. In contrast, Tsk of AB rose to a peak during the first 10 min and then showed a decreasing trend. VO2 and HR remained stable in both groups throughout the exercise period. Following an initial increase in Qc from minute 10 to minute 20 in both groups, values for WD continually decreased until Qc at 80 min was 14% lower than at 10 min. The findings suggest that the WD women had greater thermoregulatory strain than the AB women as indicated by a higher Tor and Tsk and by an inability to maintain Qc due to paralysis of the lower limbs and perhaps an increase in cutaneous blood volume."

    "abstract": "Emergence of recreational drug abuse as a major risk factor for stroke in young adults OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical and epidemiologic relations between recreational drug abuse and stroke in young persons. DESIGN: A case-control study based on medical records. SETTING: San Francisco General Hospital, a 400-bed municipal hospital. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 214 patients aged 15 to 44 years, admitted between 1979 and 1988 with a diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. An equal number of control patients admitted with diagnoses of status asthmaticus, acute appendicitis, or acute cholecystitis were matched to stroke patients by age, sex, and year of hospitalization. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-three patients with stroke (34%) were drug abusers compared with 18 (8%) of the controls. In 47 patients with stroke, temporal proximity of drug administration (n = 34) or infectious endocarditis (n = 13) suggested a direct association between drug abuse and stroke. After controlling for other identifiable stroke risk factors, the estimated relative risk for stroke among drug abusers compared with that among non-drug abusers was 6.5 (95% CI, 3.1 to 13.6), and this increased to 49.4 (CI, 6.4 to 379.0) for those patients whose symptoms began within 6 hours of drug administration. Among patients less than 35 years of age, drug abuse was the most commonly identified potential predisposing condition (47%), and it was the only condition with a significantly elevated relative risk for stroke (11.7; CI, 3.2 to 42.5). Further, a substantial rise in the proportion of drug-related strokes was observed in the last 3 years of the study (31% in 1986 to 1988, compared with 15% in 1979 to 1985, P = 0.008). Cocaine, especially recently, was the drug used most frequently in drug-related strokes. CONCLUSION: In an urban population such as ours, recreational drug abuse appears to be a prominent and growing risk factor for strokes in young adults."

Involvement of neuroexcitatory mechanisms in cerebral ischemia and brain injury was explored in experimental models of repetitive forebrain ischemia by temporary occlusion of carotid arteries in gerbils and cryogenic injury to the cerebral cortex in rats and gerbils. Our observations in these models revealed a pattern of injury that involved some anatomic structures outside the areas of direct ischemic or traumatic insult. Such foci of injury revealed conspicuously abnormal uptake of 45Ca associated with slight or moderate neuronal alteration, whereas severely injured areas showed no 45Ca uptake. Electron microscopic observations revealed a characteristic presence of calcium in swollen dendrites, closely resembling pictures obtained in neuroexcitatory conditions such as epileptic seizures. Abnormal uptake of 45Ca was associated with apparent blood-brain barrier changes characterized by intracytoplasmic uptake of extravasated albumin into the neurons. Protein synthesis assayed by in vivo [3H]leucine incorporation was reduced in regions showing calcium accumulation. Our observations suggest that neuroexcitation may play an important role in development of secondary and chronic changes after ischemic or traumatic brain insults."

A perivascular, lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils was present in the dermis, fascia, and skeletal muscle. Lymphocytic infiltration of arteries and arterioles was seen. Ultrastructurally, capillary and arteriolar endothelial cell thickening and necrosis was present.

After the second episode of right-sided hemiparesis, he underwent transoral surgical exploration, with anterior decompression and odontoidectomy. Histologic examination of the surgical material revealed granulation tissue, fibrosis, and chronic inflammation, consistent with abscess formation with invasion and compression of the spinal cord and bone. This case suggests that nonreducible rotational head tilt to the side opposite the side of lateral mass collapse should raise the suspicion of a possible infection."

Using a three-stage survey technique, respondents were asked to answer two open-ended questions about the most challenging geriatric problems they face and what specific geriatric content areas would attract their participation in an educational program. They were then asked to rank 34 topics on which they would like more information. A total of 242 responses were received for a 55% response rate (63 of the 500 were undeliverable). Responses indicated that physicians are more concerned with management than diagnosis and revealed considerable evidence of empathy and concern. The top three topics had to do with the management of dementia, multiple problems, and depression. Approximately 25% of physicians consider problems of financing health care as among the most challenging problems."

Computed tomography of the head showed multiple hypodense lesions. Neuropathologic examination showed that in addition to human immunodeficiency virus encephalomyelitis, there was multifocal meningoencephalitis with trophozoites and cysts morphologically indistinguishable from those of Acanthamoeba. These organisms were also found in the kidneys and adrenal glands. By immunofluorescence, the parasites showed antigenic identity with a free-living leptomyxid ameba and failed to react with any of a spectrum of antiacanthamoeba antisera. This emphasizes the importance of immunofluorescence identification of morphologically indistinguishable ameba species."

A mild electric shock applied to the lower lip was used to elicit reliable evoked potentials from the trigeminal nerve in 20 normal young adults. The wave forms were morphologically similar to those observed with invasive procedures. No substantial differences for either the right or left side of stimulation, recording electrode, or subject sex were obtained for any of the individual potential amplitudes or latencies. The same procedures were applied to 10 patients who had been treated with retrogasserian glycerol injections for trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal evoked potentials were elicited in all patients, although the quality of the individual wave forms was more variable than that observed for the normal subjects. Comparison of the treated with the unaffected face side in the patients demonstrated significantly smaller N2-P2 amplitudes and longer N2 latencies for the affected face side. The results suggest that these procedures produce reliable evoked potential measures of trigeminal nerve function noninvasively which can provide an objective index of treatment efficacy."

Olfactory bulb kindling rates were studied in two inbred strains of genetically seizure-prone mice (DBA/2 and El) and in three non-epileptic inbred strains [C57BL/6 (B6), ddY, and C3H/He (C3H)]. None of the DBA/2 mice had been stimulated to seizure before or during the kindling and all mice were studied at 4-6 weeks of age, before development of spontaneous or movement-induced seizure activity in the El strain. The audiogenically seizure-susceptible DBA/2 mice required the fewest number of stimulations to reach stage 5 seizure (mean +/- SE = 4.0 +/- 0.6). The nonepileptic C3H mice required the most stimulations to reach stage 5 seizures (22.6 +/- 1.4). Kindling rates for B6 (9.6 +/- 0.6), El (14.8 +/- 1.1), and ddY (18.5 +/- 1.0) strains were intermediate, and the kindling rate for each strain was significantly different from that of the other strains. These findings show that the seizure-susceptible El mouse kindles more rapidly than the genetically similar but nonepileptic ddY control and suggest that an inherited seizure susceptibility accelerates the kindling rate. Nonepileptic B6 mice kindled more rapidly than El mice, however, suggesting that genetic factors other than those that influence seizure susceptibility are of primary importance in the determination of the kindling rate."

Computed tomography demonstrated acute hydrocephalus less than or equal to 72 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage in 24 (23%) of 104 patients. Of these 24 patients, six (25%) had no impairment of consciousness. In nine (11%) of the remaining 80 patients, acute hydrocephalus developed within 1 week after subarachnoid hemorrhage. With the exception of three patients, all 104 patients received antifibrinolytic treatment. Delayed clinical deterioration from acute hydrocephalus occurred in seven (29%) of the 24 patients with acute hydrocephalus on admission and in six (8%) of the remaining 80 patients. Serial lumbar puncture was performed in 17 patients. Twelve (71%) of the 17 patients treated with serial lumbar puncture, including 10 (77%) of the 13 patients with delayed deterioration from acute hydrocephalus after admission, achieved improvement in the level of consciousness. Four of these 17 patients (4% of all 104 patients) required an internal shunt. No patient deteriorated from coning following serial lumbar puncture. The rebleeding rate within 12 days after subarachnoid hemorrhage in hydrocephalic patients with serial lumbar puncture was not higher than the rate in those without hydrocephalus (two [12%] of 17 versus nine [13%] of 71). Neither meningitis nor ventriculitis was observed. We conclude that if neither a hematoma with a mass effect nor an obstructive element exists, cerebrospinal fluid drainage with serial lumbar puncture is a good alternative to ventricular drainage in patients with acute hydrocephalus after subarachnoid hemorrhage."

Postoperative pain, flexion contracture, extension lag, and range of motion all contributed significant information to the final score, whereas other variables (walking, function, strength, and instability) did not contribute any additional information. Although higher overall scores may have been expected if the patients had patellae, the results during the follow-up examination were satisfactory and justified TKA in these patients.

A retrospective study of 16 patients was undertaken to identify physical features that may typify neonates with Prader-Willi syndrome. Several features known to be typical of Prader-Willi syndrome in early infancy were confirmed, including hypotonia and genital hypoplasia. A number of features that have not previously been emphasized as characterizing Prader-Willi syndrome were also identified, most notably abnormal cry and, in males, signs of genital hypoplasia but with an apparently normal phallus. Other features included disproportionately large head circumference, disproportionately large anterior fontanelle, mild micrognathia, mild anomalies of the gingivae or alveolar ridges, and changes in the appearance of the skin. Appreciation of these features may assist the pediatrician in recognizing the child with Prader-Willi syndrome during the neonatal period, before the appearance of better-known findings of later onset, such as obesity and acromicria."

The facial nerve is sometimes severed during the removal of acoustic neurinomas, either intentionally to ensure complete removal, or unintentionally because of difficulties in identification. In such cases we have, if possible, sutured the nerve stumps microsurgically, either end to end or by use of an intervening nerve graft. We analyzed the outcome of 25 instances of facial nerve suturing in a series of 219 patients operated on for acoustic neurinoma from 1979 to 1987. The first signs of recovery appeared at an average of 12 months, and there was continued improvement for several years. Recovery was graded from 1 to 6. The anastomosis was successful in 24 of the 25 sutured nerves, in that at least some facial movement and tone were restored (Grade 5 or higher). In 11 of the 25 cases, facial appearance at rest and with movement was moderately good (Grade 2 or 3). A Grade 1 result, with no perceivable facial dysfunction, was never achieved. Typically, oral muscles showed the most improvement and frontal muscles the least. Facial appearance was better at rest than with movement, which was always complicated by some degree of synkinesis. Closure of the eye was so good in 13 of the 25 cases that neither tarsorrhaphy nor an eyelid spring was necessary. When the facial nerve is severed, intraoperative suture is recommended, because it provides a chance for moderately good restoration of facial appearance."

To treat seven patients with slit ventricle syndrome caused by paroxysms of elevated intracranial pressure, we successfully used antimigraine therapy rather than standard calvarial expansion procedures. None of these patients has required shunt revision or calvarial expansion during a mean follow-up period of 2 years. The symptoms of slit ventricle syndrome may be a form of \"acquired\" migraine in shunt patients. We suggest that, in clinically stable patients with normal shunt function, treatment against migraine may stabilize symptoms resulting from paroxysms of increased intracranial pressure. Such treatment may prevent unnecessary shunt revisions and/or calvarial expansion procedures."

Superiorly and inferiorly based sternocleidomastoid flaps and posterior plication of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system were evaluated for their ability to ameliorate both consequences. Sixteen patients with sternocleidomastoid flaps and 16 patients with superficial musculoaponeurotic system plication were compared to a control group of 104 patients. The incidence of Frey's syndrome was 47.1% in the control group, 12.5% (P = 0.025) in the sternocleidomastoid flap group, and 0% (P = 0.005) in the superficial musculoaponeurotic system plication group. The surgical techniques are described. The prevalence of Frey's syndrome is discussed with respect to age, sex, radiation therapy, and the type of parotidectomy performed. The indications and contraindications of the three surgical techniques are described."

As the summary presentation of a symposium on prenatal alcohol-induced brain damage and long-term postnatal consequences, this paper proposes the establishment of two main research priorities--to begin to correlate long-term behavioral effects with alterations in underlying neural substrates, and to explore the mechanisms of neuroteratogenicity. To reach these goals, three objectives are described. First, animal and human research must become more interrelated. Second, experimental observations should be integrated into formal models that incorporate both neural structure and function. Third, researchers should choose well-defined dependent measures that are derived from models of brain function based on modern concepts of cognitive neuroscience. Examples of neuropsychological tests that may serve as the bases for structure/function relationships are presented. Incorporating these objectives into future research will facilitate understanding of the fundamental issues concerning prenatal alcohol exposure and will begin to provide the bases for rational intervention or treatment."

Perivascular innervation in cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats and of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats was studied. Adrenergic nerve fibers and neuropeptide Y-containing nerve fibers, indicative of vasoconstrictor nerves, were denser in all cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats than those of Wistar-Kyoto rats. In contrast, cholinergic nerve fibers and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, substance P-containing nerve fibers, indicative of vasodilator nerves, remained unchanged in all cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats, as compared with findings in the Wistar-Kyoto rats. Thus, not only adrenergic nerve fibers but also neuropeptide Y-containing nerve fibers may play an important role in preventing the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and the development of hypertensive encephalopathy in spontaneously hypertensive rats."

A 46-month, retrospective review of all victims of fatal head injury at a level 1 trauma center was undertaken to estimate donor organ availability, determine causes of procurement failure, and analyze the functional results of organs transplanted from this group of donors. Causes of procurement failure in 126 patients who died principally from their head injuries included failure of initial resuscitation (14%), ineligibility (28%), failure of physiologic support (14%), and denial of consent (20%). Of 73 eligible donors, 29 (41%) were able to donate one or more vascular organs (heart, liver, kidney). In only one instance was an eligible donor not appropriately identified as such. Failure of physiologic support to prevent early death (25%), and denial of consent (34%) were found to be the two major, potentially remediable causes of procurement failure in this series. Based on this data, an estimated 29 patients/million population/year will survive initially and meet all eligibility requirements for organ donation. Data on 47 kidneys transplanted from the donor group demonstrated a 77% overall graft survival rate at a follow-up period averaging 23 months. Prolonged donor hypotension, but not the use of high-dose vasopressors, adversely affected allograft survival. The current limitations of organ procurement in victims of fatal head injury stem from a limited ability to maintain cardiopulmonary function long enough for the procurement process to be completed and a high overall rate (46%) of denial of consent for organ harvest by next of kin."

The influence of the prenatal and postnatal maternal environment on stroke susceptibility was evaluated by reciprocally crossing the spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS/Jr) inbred rat strains to produce reciprocal F1 hybrids that were nurtured, respectively, during prenatal and postnatal life by SHR or SS/Jr mothers. Following placement on a high-salt diet containing 8% NaCl at 35 days of age, F1 rats reared by SHR mothers had shorter survival times and were more likely to die with cerebral hemorrhage than F1s reared by SS/Jrs. Across reciprocal F1 female groups, enhanced susceptibility to stroke was associated with greater elevations of systolic blood pressure, but this association was not seen across reciprocal F1 male groups. There was also an association between blood pressure and stroke within each F1/gender subgroup: Rats eventually suffering strokes developed higher blood pressure after placement on the high-salt diet than rats that did not suffer stroke. Lower day 35 body weights (before exposure to the high-salt diet) were associated with greater likelihood of stroke both across the reciprocal F1 groups, and within three of the four F1/gender subgroups. The differences in stroke susceptibility between the reciprocal F1 groupings may be due to systematic differences in the prenatal and/or postnatal environments of SHR and SS/Jr mothers and may be mediated by variations in the nutritive capacity of the two inbred mothers."

In 12 of the eyes the examinations were repeated within one year in order to follow changes in retinal light sensitivity during the evolution of the lesions. Retinal cotton-wool spots were in all eyes associated with localised non-arcuate scotomata in the visual field. In four eyes the cotton-wool spots disappeared within three months of the first examination, and in two of these cases the corresponding scotomata disappeared together with the morphological lesions. In eight eyes the cotton-wool spots (and the corresponding scotomata) had not resolved one year after the first examination.

Autografts of adrenal medulla were implanted into preformed cavities in the caudate nuclei of four rhesus monkeys with hemiparkinsonism induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Five other hemiparkinsonian monkeys underwent caudate cavitation, but received no tissue implant. All of the animals had marked bradykinesia of the affected arm and stable apomorphine-induced turning before cavitation or implantation. Moderate behavioral recovery was seen in all five monkeys with cavitation and two of the three monkey with long-term adrenal autografts (the fourth adrenal recipient was sacrificed 10 days after grafting). The improvement occurred months after the procedure and was not as early or as complete as that seen after fetal dopaminergic grafts. Surviving adrenal tissue was found only in the animal that showed no behavioral recovery. The other two adrenal autograft recipients (with no surviving adrenal medulla) and all of the animals with cavitation had ingrowth of dopaminergic fibers from the area olfactoria and nucleus accumbens into the caudate, oriented toward the cavity. These findings show that the mechanism of improvement after adrenal medullary implants for parkinsonism is not dopamine secretion by chromaffin cells, but may be related to the sprouted host fibers. The results also indicate that the limited recovery after adrenal implants in parkinsonian patients may be a result of the cavitation, and not necessarily the result of tissue implantation."

Outcome after traumatic brain injury, defined by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and length of stay in acute rehabilitation, was measured in 59 patients admitted to an intensive rehabilitation program to examine the effects of severity of the initial brain injury, severity of multiple trauma, and length of stay in the acute care hospital. Severity of initial brain injury, best measured by length of coma, was the most significant predictor of GOS outcome. Length of acute hospitalization was a small, but significant, predictor of GOS. Severity of initial brain injury, length of acute hospitalization, and gender emerged as predictors of length of rehabilitation hospital stay. Although length of acute hospitalization is apparently affected by severity of brain injury, it adds significantly--more than severity of brain injury--to the prediction of length of rehabilitation."

Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug with minimal extrapyramidal toxicity recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for hard-to-treat schizophrenic patients. We reviewed information on 1,418 patients treated with clozapine in the United States between 1972 and 1988. Forty-one of 1,418 (2.8%) patients had generalized tonic-clonic seizures during treatment with clozapine. Life-table analysis predicts a cumulative 10% risk of seizures after 3.8 years of treatment. Clozapine-related seizures appear to be dose-related. High-dose therapy (greater than or equal to 600 mg/day) was associated with a greater risk of seizures (4.4%) than medium (300 to 600 mg/day; 2.7%) or low doses (less than 300 mg/day; 1.0%). Also, rapid upward titration may increase seizure risk. Thirty-one of 41 patients were successfully continued on clozapine despite seizure occurrence, either with reduction of dose or addition of an antiepileptic medication. Recognition and treatment of clozapine-related seizures will become increasingly important as its use grows in the 1990s."

In our study we selected detailed methods for assessment of all these aspects. Interrelationships were studied in 30 mild to moderately impaired patients with dementia and their caregivers. Although the relations of cognitive deterioration to disability in daily life and of burden experienced by the caregiver to patient's condition were stronger than often reported, it was impossible to deduce the overall severity of dementia from one single aspect. Thus, for effective management of patients and caregivers, for evaluation of individual treatment or of clinical trials, attention should be paid to all the different aspects of patients' condition and caregivers' burden. Outcome measurements will then be more valid."

    "abstract": "Experiential phenomena of temporal lobe epilepsy. Facts and hypotheses. Experiential phenomena that occur in temporal lobe seizures and can be reproduced by electrical stimulation of temporal lobe structures typically encompass perceptual, mnemonic and affective features, either in combination or in isolation, which commonly relate to the patient's individual past experience. These phenomena raise interesting questions concerning brain mechanisms involved in human psychophysiology. The anatomical substrates for the evocation of these phenomena are widely distributed within the temporal lobe and include temporal isocortex and limbic structures (amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus). Arguments are presented which indicate that experiential phenomena are positive expressions of temporal lobe and limbic function and do not result from its ictal paralysis. Recent concepts of parallel distributed processing (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986) and the importance of parallel distributed cortical networks for higher cognitive functions (Goldman-Rakic, 1988a, b) provide a theoretical framework on which a hypothesis explaining experiential phenomena can be based. In conformity with these concepts the hypothesis assumes that temporal lobe epileptic discharge or electrical stimulation of temporal lobe structures can induce the elaboration of patterns of excitation and inhibition in widely distributed neuronal networks, some of which are capable of forming a specific matrix representing the substrate of a given experience. Neuronal networks engaged in parallel distributed processing (1) have the capacity to recreate the totality of a given experience when only a fragment of the network is activated, and (2) they tolerate a great deal of degradation by random inactivation of its components or by interference through random noise without serious loss of information content. These features are compatible with the assumption that localized epileptic neuronal discharge or electrical stimulation involving some temporal lobe structures could create a matrix representing features of individual experience of the kind activated in the course of temporal lobe seizures. Such an experience could, up to a certain limit, resist the degrading influence of mounting noise which inevitably must attend seizure discharge."

To evaluate the methodology of tilt testing, the following were examined: reproducibility of results, tilt duration, angle of tilt, method of tilt support and effect of age in patients and control subjects. Seventy-one patients with recurrent unexplained syncope underwent 60 min of 60 degree tilt; 53 (75%) had an abnormal test with vasovagal syncope at 24 +/- 10 min (mean +/- SD). Tilting to 60 degrees resulted in an abnormal test in only 2 (7%) of 27 control subjects without cardiovascular symptoms (p less than 0.001); and 5 (15%) of 34 patients with syncope and documented conduction tissue disease (p less than 0.001). Of 15 youthful fainters, 3 (20%) had vasovagal reactions as did 1 (8%) of 12 asymptomatic youthful control subjects. These 12 control subjects also underwent tilting with a saddle support and 7 (67%) had vasovagal reactions. It is concluded that the duration of tilting at 60 degrees should be 45 min (mean time to syncope +2 x SD in the 53 patients with abnormal results). Twenty percent of patients with an abnormal tilt test may not demonstrate syncope with repeat tilting. Saddle tilt testing in unexplained syncope may result in a loss of specificity. Tilting at less than 60 degrees results in a loss of sensitivity. Head-up tilt may be less useful in youthful subjects with vasovagal syncope than in other subjects."

Ten years of study has resulted in considerable but fragmented knowledge about regional cerebral blood flow in migraine with aura (classic migraine). In the present study, the number of repeatedly studied patients (n = 63) was large enough to determine statistically significant sequences of events and statistically significant spatial relations. The first observable event was a decrease of regional cerebral blood flow posteriorly in one cerebral hemisphere. Further development of this pathological process was accompanied by the aura symptoms. Thereafter headache occurred while regional cerebral blood flow remained decreased. During the headache phase, regional cerebral blood flow gradually changed from abnormally low to abnormally high without apparent change in headache. In some patients headache disappeared while regional cerebral blood flow remained increased. Although regional cerebral blood flow reduction and aura symptoms in the great majority of patients were unilateral, one-third had bilateral headache. Unilateral headache usually localized to the side on which regional cerebral blood flow was reduced and from which the aura symptoms originated (i.e., aura symptoms were perceived to occur contralaterally but presumably originated in the hypoperfused hemisphere). Our results suggest a simple model for migraine attacks: A pathological disturbance in one cerebral hemisphere causes the aura symptoms and after a time delay, it also causes the headache by stimulating local vascular nociceptors. Bilateral headache caused by a unilateral cerebral disturbance may be explained by recent neuroanatomical and neurophysiological findings."

To provide a better understanding of the etiology of subjective sleep complaints in HIV-infected individuals, a study to evaluate sleep/wake disturbances in 10 healthy HIV-infected male volunteers was performed. All subjects were HIV-infected but had no history of AIDS-related infections, and considered clinically asymptomatic. Interviews and sleep questionnaires revealed sleep complaints in nine subjects. Five healthy HIV-seronegative male subjects, with no history of sleep complaints, were also evaluated. Sleep architecture analyses detected that, in comparison to published normative data and to negative controls, there was a significant increase in the total percentage of slow wave sleep (SWS) and an increase in the percentage of SWS in the later sleep cycles. When compared with normative data, an increase in stage 1 shifts, rapid eye movement (REM) periods, and arousals were also observed in the HIV-infected group. Significant decreases in sleep latency, total percentage stage 2 sleep, and average REM durations were also observed in the HIV-infected group compared with normative data. These sleep architecture abnormalities could not be attributed to known sole primary sleep disorders, first night effect, medications, anxiety or depression. This study indicates that sleep disturbances occur early in the course of HIV infection and suggests that the observed alterations of sleep physiology may be a consequence of central nervous system involvement and/or immune defense mobilization in the early phases of HIV infection."

Forty-five (9.9%) of 453 pituitary adenomas operated on between January 1973 and November 1988 demonstrated hemorrhagic changes at surgery: 24 had a blood collection, 12 had a blood collection associated with hemorrhagic necrosis, and 9 had hemorrhagic necrosis. Thirteen patients (28.9%) experienced the acute symptoms of pituitary apoplexy, whereas another 32 had an \"asymptomatic\" hemorrhage, that is, the clinical course was comparable to an uncomplicated adenoma. Nineteen tumors (42.2%) showed marked suprasellar extension, 8 (17.8%) showed moderate extension, and 11 (24.5%) showed slight extension; another 2 (4.4%) were laterosellar and 5 (11.1%) were intrasellar. Invasive behavior was present in 32 cases (71.1%) and this may suggest another hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of tumoral hemorrhage. The incidence of hemorrhagic complications in invasive adenomas with marked suprasellar extension was particularly impressive; therefore, we do not suggest preoperative bromocriptine treatment in this type of tumor. Two of 14 patients operated on by the transcranial route died after surgery, whereas there was no operative mortality in the 31 patients operated on by the transsphenoidal route. It proved advantageous to operate as early as possible, even during the acute phase of pituitary apoplexy. The transsphenoidal approach gave the best results, but to achieve satisfactory late results multidisciplinary treatment was necessary, namely, postoperative radiotherapy in 23 patients, bromocriptine in 12, and endocrine replacement therapy in almost all.

Two-point occlusions of the basilar artery in 12 rats produced variable infarcts between the occlusion sites but no ischemic lesions elsewhere. After either single- or double-point occlusions, the proximal basilar artery refilled within 2-3 minutes. When the basilar artery was occluded above and below the origins of the anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, the artery segments between the occlusion points initially collapsed but refilled within 2-3 minutes in two rats. Basilar artery occlusions invariably suppressed cortical somatosensory evoked potentials by greater than 50%. Regardless of whether a brain stem infarct developed, somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes recovered to greater than baseline levels by 4 hours in seven of 17 rats and returned to baseline levels by 24 hours in every rat tested. We conclude that the occluded basilar artery receives extensive retrograde collateral blood flow and that somatosensory evoked potentials are exquisitely sensitive to basilar artery occlusion but are insensitive to whether brain stem infarcts develop."

    "abstract": "Relaxation training in school classes does not reduce headache complaints. The effect of teacher-presented Progressive Relaxation Training (PRT) on headaches, fear of failure and school problems was studied in school students. During ten physical education lessons, students received either PRT (n = 110) or placebo training (n = 92). The effect of the training was investigated in students who indicated the presence of headaches in a pre-training diary. No significant differences were found between both training groups regarding headache frequency, duration and intensity and the psychological variables. On the basis of these and previous findings, it is recommended to present PRT to fairly small groups of self-selected subjects instead of complete classes."

Facial nerve involvement in cerebellopontine angle tumors, both during their development and after excision, may be expressed in irreversible dysfunction of the parasympathetic pathways. The exact location of the lesion along the efferent nerve fibers can be established through evaluation of the functional level of those organs supplied by the cholinergic motor secretory components. This report deals with a female patient in whom peripheral facial palsy developed shortly after removal of a right cerebellopontine angle meningioma. She had slight facial asymmetry and deafness in the right ear and complained of prandial flush and sweating of the right malar area. Occult ipsilateral hyposalivation and hypolacrimation were diagnosed. In patients with seventh and ninth cranial nerve pathoses, evaluation of the end organs that are supplied by their associated autonomous nerve fibers is mandatory to prevent late ocular and oral sequelae."

To assess the role of alpha-tumor necrosis factor in the pathogenesis of central nervous system involvement during human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection, we recorded clinical data and measured alpha-tumor necrosis factor levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples from 45 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1, classified as group II/III (10), group IV A (5), group IV B (10), and group IV C-1 (20) of the Centers for Disease Control acquired immunodeficiency syndrome classification system and 42 controls. Alpha-tumor necrosis factor was above the limit of detection in only 3 of 15 sera and 3 of 15 cerebrospinal fluid samples from patients in group II/III and group IV A, whereas it was detected in 17 of 30 sera (p less than 0.05) and 22 of 30 cerebrospinal fluid (p less than 0.0002) samples from clinically more advanced patients (group IV B and group IV C-1). Alpha-tumor necrosis factor mean values were 21.5 pg/ml in sera and 50.0 pg/ml in cerebrospinal fluid from group IV B patients and 30.4 pg/ml in sera and 24 pg/ml in cerebrospinal fluid from group IV C-1 patients."

All patients were examined at admission and at 1 and 2 years postinjury. This series identified 77 (15.2%) multilevel fractures. Motor vehicle accidents were the primary cause of these fractures. The incidence of neurologic injury was not significantly different between multiple noncontiguous and single fractures. Failure to use seat belts and ejection from the vehicle were the main factors associated with multiple noncontiguous spine injuries. Seven major fracture patterns were identified, which accounted for 60% of these injuries.

Fifty asthmatic patients and 20 healthy control subjects, carefully age- and sex-matched, were subjected to seven standardized tests to evaluate their autonomic status. Due care was taken to remove factors which could interfere with results. Of the tests concerned with the parasympathetic system, the intravenous atropine test (p greater than 0.10) and heart rate response to standing (p greater than 0.01) which measured the basal parasympathetic tone, did not show a significant difference. Tests requiring stimulation of the parasympathetic system, ie, deep breathing test (p less than 0.001), Valsalva maneuver (p less than 0.001), and carotid sinus massage (p less than 0.001) showed significantly heightened response. Postural fall of blood pressure (p greater than 0.10) and sustained hand grip test (p greater than 0.10), chiefly concerned with the sympathetic system, did not show a significant difference. Of the 50 asthmatic patients, nine were atopic and 41 nonatopic. When the results were compared in the two groups separately, we found that there was no alteration in the measurements except the intravenous atropine test which showed heightened response with atopic subjects (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that hyperresponsiveness of the parasympathetic system is an important factor in producing bronchial spasm in asthmatic patients, and atopic and nonatopic subjects do not differ much in their autonomic status."

The accuracy with which electrical sources in the brain can be localized by using electroencephalograms measured on the scalp is not well known. In this study, tests of localization accuracy were performed by using implanted dipolar sources in the human brain. These dipoles are created by passing a weak (subthreshold) current through intracerebral electrodes implanted in the brains of epileptic patients for seizure monitoring. The locations of these dipoles are accurately known from roentgenographs. First, 16 electroencephalograms produced by these dipoles were recorded, then inverse solutions were calculated for the apparent sources of these electroencephalograms. Finally, the locations of the apparent sources were compared with the known locations of the implanted dipoles to determine localization error. The average localization error for a total of 28 dipoles in 3 subjects was 1.1 cm. These results indicate that good localization accuracy for focal sources in the brain can be provided by scalp electroencephalograms."

    "abstract": "Task-dependent variations in parkinsonian motor impairments. Studies of visually-guided arm movements in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have suggested a relationship between slowness of movement and a reduction in the ratio of movement amplitude and peak velocity. Recent studies indicate, however, that PD impairments may be different for well-learned, natural movements performed without visual guidance, or movements associated with sequential motor behaviours such as speech. To address this issue, PD subjects and age/sex-matched controls were compared on the performance of three tasks, all of which required lowering the jaw: (1) single, rapid, visually-guided movements; (2) equivalent movements associated with a single speech syllable (inherently without visual guidance), and (3) well-learned speech movements produced in a natural sequence. PD subjects manifested similar deficits for visually-guided jaw lowering as those previously reported for arm movements, namely reduced velocity/amplitude ratios and increased movement durations. By contrast, analogous jaw movements during the sequential speech tasks were unimpaired on these measures. These results suggest that PD motor impairments are influenced by a variety of factors, including the degree to which tasks are familiar and natural, and the availability of visual information."

The combination of cisplatin plus dacarbazine (DTIC) is active in metastatic melanoma with response rates reported between 10% and 55%. To optimize this regimen, a Phase II study was conducted employing a dose intensity of cisplatin higher than previously reported. Twenty-two patients were treated. Eight patients received cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 combined with DTIC 300 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 8 and 9 (regimen A). Because of excessive toxicity, the protocol was modified so that cisplatin was given at 50 mg/m2 per day and DTIC 350 mg/m2 per day on days 1 through 3 (regimen B). The overall response rate was 32% and consisted of four partial and three complete responses (CR). The median duration of response was 6 months. Two of the CR remain in sustained, unmaintained remission in excess of 1.5 years. All seven patients that responded were treated on regimen B. High-dose cisplatin plus DTIC on a 3-day schedule represents an effective, well-tolerated therapy for metastatic melanoma."

The results of reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament with the central third of the patellar ligament as a free, autogenous, non-vascularized graft were retrospectively reviewed at our institution. Eighty reconstructions in seventy-nine patients were evaluated after a minimum of two years. In forty-eight (60 per cent) of the knees, the reconstruction was augmented with an extra-articular lateral sling of iliotibial band. The patients were evaluated with a physical examination, a KT-1000 arthrometer, radiographs, a subjective questionnaire, and a revision of the scale of The Hospital for Special Surgery for rating ligaments. Postoperatively, seventy-six (95 per cent) of the eighty knees no longer gave way, and the pivot-shift test was negative in sixty-seven (84 per cent) of the knees. The average score on the ligament-rating scale was 93 points. All of the patients who had clinical instability at the time of the most recent follow-up had associated ligamentous instability that had not been appreciated or addressed at the time of reconstruction. Arthrometric evaluation revealed that the laxity differed by three millimeters or less from that of the untreated knee in sixty (76 per cent) of the treated knees. In the patient who had bilateral reconstruction, the laxity was the same in both knees. Seventeen patients, who had more than three millimeters of translation, also had additional related ligamentous instability, most commonly posterolateral instability and insufficiency of the medial collateral ligament. We think that major associated ligamentous instability predisposes the reconstruction to failure and should be corrected in conjunction with the reconstruction."

We studied 2 patients with congenital mirror movements by means of various neurophysiological and metabolic techniques, including mapping of motor evoked potentials to transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation, premovement and somatosensory evoked potentials, kinematics of voluntary movements, muscle reflexes, and positron emission tomography (PET). Abnormalities in maps of motor and premovement potentials and in PET scans were consistent with a bilateral representation of hand muscles in the motor cortex, the existence of physiologically active connections capable of conducting fast efferent volleys from the motor cortex to ipsilateral muscles, the presence of mirror EMG activity in either hand with intended voluntary movement of the other hand, the absence of mirrored EMG responses from wrist flexors and extensors to mechanical perturbation of the contralateral wrist, and normal scalp distribution of somatosensory evoked potentials to right and left median nerve stimulation. Our findings are consistent with aberrant organization of motor representation areas and corticospinal pathways with ipsilateral as well as contralateral control of voluntary movement."

All symptoms and signs had completely resolved within 24 hours, and any episodes suggestive of posterior fossa ischaemia were excluded. Computed tomography, done after the clinical features had resolved, showed 79 relevant infarcts: 46 were small, deep, lacunar infarcts (58%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 47-69%), and 33 were larger cortical infarcts. The histories and the type of infarct in these 79 patients were compared to see whether lacunar infarcts were preceded by a history of unilateral motor or sensory symptoms without features usually attributed to the cerebral cortex. The positive predictive value of such lacunar symptoms was 0.74, with a negative predictive value of 0.61. 11 patients had a cortical infarct despite a history of lacunar TIAs, but only one occurred in the left hemisphere and speech was not affected. Of 527 patients with transient ischaemic attacks without a relevant infarct visible on computed tomography, 335 (64%) had a history suggestive of lacunar ischaemia, whereas in several other studies 20-25% of patients with ischaemic stroke have evidence of lacunar infarcts. Lacunar TIAs may therefore have a better prognosis than cortical TIAs or may often precede cortical infarcts; alternatively, many cortical infarcts may occur without warning."

The index patient, a 56-year-old white man with a history of purulent meningitis at the age of 23 years, presented with an acute meningococcal meningitis. No impairment of cellular immunity or immunoglobulin deficiency could be found. Complement assays showed a complete deficiency of the C9 component, while the other individual component levels were normal and the hemolytic activity (measured using the CH50 assay) was only slightly reduced. A family study revealed complete C9 deficiency in the patient's healthy brother and half-normal C9 concentrations in his sister, his son (who also had experienced an episode of bacterial meningitis), and his niece, consistent with an inherited C9 deficiency. This first case of recurrent meningitis in a white patient with complete C9 deficiency suggests that this complement defect may also be a risk factor for bacterial, especially neisserial, infections."

Experimental procedures included single and double labeling in situ immunohistochemistry with selective morphometric analyses, and steady state immunoblotting of viral proteins. Cellular targets for virus infection were identical for both ts1 and wt MoMuLV and consisted sequentially of 1) splenic megakaryocytes, 2) splenic and thymic lymphocytes, 3) CNS capillary endothelial cells, and 4) CNS pericytes and microglia. Resident microglial cells served as the major reservor and amplifier of virus infection in the CNS of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice; a similar but much less significant role was played by microglia in wt MoMuLV-infected mice. The genesis and progression of severe spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice were both temporally and spatially correlated with amplified virus infection of microglia, and hyperplasia and hypertrophy of both virus-infected and nonvirus-infected microglial cells. Direct virus infection of neurons was never observed. The development of clinical neurologic disease and spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice correlated with the accumulation of both viral gag and env gene products in the CNS; there was no selective accumulation of env precursor polyprotein Pr80env. When compared to wt MoMuLV-infected mice, the neurovirulence of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice occurred by an enhanced ability to replicate in the CNS and to infect and activate more microglia, rather than by a fundamental change in cellular tropism or topography of virus infection."

In 58 breast cancer patients with meningeal carcinomatosis (MC) pretreatment characteristics, clinical course, and response to treatment were evaluated. Forty-four patients were uniformly treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. Fourteen patients did not receive intraventricular treatment. In the intraventricularly treated group the median survival was 12 weeks. Multivariate analysis of the pretreatment characteristics of the intraventricularly treated patients demonstrated a prognostic significance with respect to survival for age older than 55 years, lung metastases, cranial nerve involvement, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose less than 2.5 mmol/l, and CSF protein 0.51 to 1.0 g/l. Based on the significance of these predicting factors a prognostic index (PI) identified four groups of patients with a median survival of 43 weeks, 22 weeks, 11 weeks, and 3 weeks, respectively. After 6 weeks of intraventricular treatment 22 patients showed a neurologic improvement or stabilization, and nine patients showed a worsening of the neurologic signs, whereas 13 patients (30%) had already died. The responders had a median additional survival of 5 months versus 1 month for nonresponders. No relation was found between survival and intensity of the intraventricular treatment after the first 6 weeks of treatment. Almost all long survivors had also received systemic treatment for systemic disease, whereas most patients who died within 6 months did not receive systemic therapy. Radiation therapy had no influence on the survival time. Early death due to the intensive treatment occurred in three patients. In 11 of the 17 patients who survived more than 4 months an often seriously debilitating late neurotoxicity developed. The survival curve of the nonintraventricularly treated patients appeared to be essentially the same as the curve of the intraventricularly treated patients. Using the same PI the predicted survival time was also the same as in the intraventricularly treated group. It is concluded that survival in MC from breast carcinoma may be more dependent on some pretreatment characteristics than on treatment intensity. On the basis of these pretreatment characteristics the survival time seems to be predictable. Finally, late neurotoxicity due to aggressive treatment leads to impairment of the quality of life in more than 50% of the long survivors. The exact value of intraventricular and systemic therapy in patients with MC still has to be determined."

Human movement systems have frequently been treated as one-dimensional, single-axis, rigid bodies in order to simplify the gathering, analysis, and interpretation of data. The problem with this approach is that the results of such assumptions often lead to conclusions about the production and control of movement that do not relate to the control demands placed on the central nervous system. In order to truly understand how the central nervous system plans and produces movements to match environmental demands, we must take into account the many variations available within the body. The purpose of this article is to examine two movement systems that have the potential to act in multiple spatial dimensions with variable muscle action patterns when performing a stabilizing task. Methods of analyzing how the systems operate under differing task constraints and results of the experiments will be presented. Hypothetical models that have been proposed to explain how complex movement systems operate will also be discussed."

Arachnoid cysts of the spinal canal are relatively common lesions that may be either intra- or extradural. These cysts are usually asymptomatic but may produce symptoms by compressing the spinal cord or nerve roots. We report a case in which an intradural thoracic arachnoid cyst became symptomatic after a routine decompressive lumbar laminectomy for spinal stenosis. Myelography revealed no abnormality, although magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography after myelography demonstrated a mass within the posterior aspect of the thoracic spinal canal associated with anterior displacement and compression of the spinal cord. A change in the flow dynamics of the cerebrospinal fluid probably allowed the development of spinal cord compression due to one of the following: expansion of the cyst, decreased cerebrospinal fluid buffer between the cord and the cyst, or epidural venous engorgement. A concomitant and more cephalad lesion such as an arachnoid cyst should be considered when myelopathic complications arise after lumbar surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography after myelography are useful to demonstrate the additional pathological processes."

In acute quadriplegia we have noted that about one in five patients develops unexplained production of markedly excessive and tenacious bronchial mucus. Spontaneous recovery from mucus hypersecretion usually occurs within weeks to months. Mucus samples collected from 12 patients have been found to be abnormal. Macromolecular contents of single aspirates yielded as much as 500 mg. Analytical ultracentrifuge analysis showed the mucus to contain considerable epithelial glycoprotein (GP) of typical buoyant density; its amino acid and carbohydrate compositions were characteristic of the GP from hypersecretory bronchial mucus such as in chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis. In five patients studied after recovery from hypersecretion, there tended to be relatively less GP. The mucus samples contained a high density glycoconjugate (GC): this had sugars of GP but also reacted positively with a monoclonal antibody to keratan sulfate. Its amino acid composition was different from that of GP: threonine was lower and glycine was higher than in GP. In mucus from one patient who died, chondroitin sulfate ABC and hyaluronic acid were identified as well. This suggests proteoglycans are involved in the pathophysiology of mucus hypersecretion. The sudden onset and spontaneous recovery of hypersecretion suggests that it is not due to gland hypertrophy. We speculate that in acute quadriplegia it is due to disturbed neuronal control of bronchial mucus gland secretion, perhaps related to initial disappearance and later reappearance of peripheral sympathetic nervous system tone."

    "abstract": "Diagnostic and prognostic value of electrophysiologic tests in meralgia paresthetica. Electrophysiologic diagnosis of unilateral meralgia paresthetica is usually assessed by side-to-side comparison of SNAP amplitudes, SNCVs, and SEP latencies following stimulation of lateral femoral cutaneous nerves. To determine the relevance for diagnosis of these tests and side-to-side comparison, the results were compared in patients with unilateral meralgia paresthetica and normal subjects. The long-term outcome was also considered, in order to determine whether electrophysiologic findings contribute to the prognosis. In our study, SNAP amplitude comparison was found to be more useful for diagnosis than SNCV and SEP latency comparisons. However the value of the SNAP amplitude on the affected side, just as the results of the other tests, was not found to be predictive of the outcome. Also the results of the tests depend on the methods used and on the nerve's route."

    "abstract": "Myasthenic thymus and thymoma are selectively enriched in acetylcholine receptor-reactive T cells. We compared T-cell proliferative responses to acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and to purified protein derivative (PPD) (of tuberculin) of hyperplastic thymus, thymoma, and blood cells from patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). Hyperplastic MG thymus cells gave significantly higher and more consistent responses to AChR than parallel cultures of autologous blood cells, whereas responses to PPD showed an opposite trend. Thus there was a preferential localization of AChR-reactive T cells in the hyperplastic MG thymus. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation between blood and thymus cell responses to PPD (but not to AChR), arguing that the hyperplastic MG thymus contains a sample of sensitized peripheral T cells. By contrast, both AChR- and PPD-responsive T cells were almost undetectable in thymus from nonmyasthenic patients, which is evidently much less receptive to circulating T cells. Cells from MG thymomas showed the highest stimulations by AChR but did not consistently react to PPD. However, the uninvolved thymus adjacent to these thymomas behaved almost identically to the hyperplastic samples described above. Our interpretation is that AChR-specific T cells are initially sensitized in the MG thymoma but are selectively trapped in the hyperplastic thymus after being primed elsewhere."

They are most commonly encountered in patients with acute myelogenous leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders in blast crisis. Rarely, patients presenting with granulocytic sarcoma show no evidence of acute leukemia. The authors report an aleukemic patient with acute paraparesis from an epidural granulocytic sarcoma. Only five such cases have been reported previously. Immunoperoxidase stain for lysozyme and chloroacetate esterase stain were used to prove the myeloid origin of the tumor cells."

    "abstract": "Telephone use to elicit voice or speech in brain injured subjects. The initiation of speech is often delayed in the early stages of recovery from a serious brain injury. We have found a high percentage of patients with both speech and swallowing problems. This makes bedside assessment of swallowing safety difficult because one cannot listen for the sound of aspirated material on the vocal cords when a patient is at high risk for silent aspiration and is often unable to cooperate with a videofluoroscopic study. The use of the telephone has been described several times for aphasia treatment, but not to elicit speech or assess swallowing safety early after brain injury. This study, therefore, recruited subjects who had brain injuries and (1) were referred early for swallowing and other evaluations, (2) were out of coma and able to follow some commands, and (3) did not initiate voice or speak when asked to. Subjects were asked three questions under two different conditions: face to face and after ringing the telephone from another room. The results were recorded on videotape and analyzed by another investigator for quantifiable differences. Six of the seven subjects responded better with the telephone stimulus than without. This technique may elicit voice or speech early after brain injury in some patients and may be useful in bedside assessment of swallowing safety. It may also serve as an example of appropriate stimulation of brain injured subjects coming out of coma."

    "abstract": "The UCLA-University of Utah epidemiologic survey of autism: the etiologic role of rare diseases. Twelve rare diseases known to cause CNS pathology were found in 26 (11%) of 233 autistic probands identified during a recent epidemiologic survey of Utah. These 26 probands had significantly lower mean IQs than the remaining patients (43 versus 60) but similar sex distribution and prevalence of abnormal EEGs and seizures. The rarity and diversity of these 12 diseases make it highly unlikely that they randomly occurred with autism. Their presence in this epidemiologic survey is the most compelling evidence to date to support the hypothesis that different diseases producing different types of CNS pathology can play an etiologic role in autism."

    "abstract": "The opposite pupil in herniation. I serially examined the pupil opposite the one already enlarged from transtentorial herniation in 13 patients. The main abnormalities, stereotyped in most patients, were an initially diminished light reaction with a 2.5- to 4-mm-diameter pupil, followed by slight reduction in size, and then reenlargement to greater than original size, all with preserved roundness. Subsequent deterioration varied among patients, but a transitional oval shape was infrequent and oculomotor function was preserved until both pupils were enlarged and fixed. Once the pupil on the side of a mass enlarges, heralding herniation, subsequent deterioration can be appreciated through changes in reactivity and size of the opposite pupil."

    "abstract": "Temporal movement control in patients with Parkinson's disease. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been reported to be unable to modify their movement velocity to adapt to changing environmental demands. For example, when movement amplitude is varied, PD patients usually exhibit a nearly constant peak velocity, whereas elderly subjects show an increase of their peak velocity with increased amplitude. The experiment examined the ability of PD patients to vary the duration of their movement (four different percentages of their maximum) under conditions where temporal, but not spatial, control was emphasised. PD patients had longer movement times than control subjects, but were able to vary the duration of their movement with comparable temporal accuracy to that of elderly subjects. For both groups, the agonist EMG activity increased with decreased movement duration. For the PD patients, the number of agonist bursts increased with increased movement duration."

    "abstract": "Early gastric cancer. Twenty-eight-year experience. A retrospective study of early gastric cancer (60 patients) was performed to evaluate its diagnosis and treatment. Ninety-five per cent of patients presented with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms and 53.3% had been treated for presumed benign disease for up to 48 months before diagnosis. Fiberoptic endoscopy detected these lesions more accurately than radiologic examination. The disease-free 5-year survival rate after resection was 76.4%. Survival showed no significant correlation with sex, tumor site, macroscopic appearance, extent of gastric resection, or histopathologic type. Tumors larger than 1.5 cm in diameter, invasion of submucosa, or lymph node metastasis resulted in significantly lower survival rates. Three of eight patients with nodal metastasis survived 5 or more years, including one who had second-echelon deposits. A high index of suspicion may permit more frequent detection. Extended lymphadenectomy (R2) is recommended to achieve the highest possible cure rate."

    "abstract": "Fatal or severely disabling cerebral infarction during hospitalization for stroke or transient ischemic attack. Six (1%) of 578 patients admitted for cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack (TIA) suffered a fatal or severely disabling in-hospital cerebral infarction following a period of stabilization or improvement lasting more than 1 day. These infarctions were characterized by the sudden onset of stupor or coma and subsequent development of transtentorial herniation due to carotid or middle cerebral artery territory infarction, or widespread brain-stem infarction due to basilar occlusion. Only one patient survived. Four patients had large-vessel disease documented by Doppler, angiography, or at autopsy. Each of these six infarcts occurred during the morning hours, 4-9 days after the initial event, 3-8 days after initiation of intravenous heparin, and within 4-8 h after intravenous heparin had been discontinued. No coagulation abnormalities were documented. We believe that these cases indicate that among patients admitted for cerebral infarction or TIA, fatal or severely disabling in-hospital cerebral infarction after a period of stabilization or improvement may occur in patients having an initially mild to moderate clinical deficit, that those suffering large artery disease may be at greater risk, and that there may be a relationship between heparin withdrawal and cerebral infarction in some patients."

    "abstract": "Neurological sequelae of cerebral malaria in children. Out of 604 Gambian children admitted with falciparum malaria to one hospital between September and December, 1988, 308 had cerebral malaria and 203 were severely anaemic (haemoglobin less than 60 g/l). 14% of those with cerebral malaria died, as did 7.8% of those with severe anaemia. 32 (12%) of children surviving cerebral malaria had residual neurological deficit. 69 other children were admitted with clinical features strongly suggestive of cerebral malaria but with negative blood films; 16 of these died and 3 had residual neurological deficits. The commonest sequelae of cerebral malaria were hemiplegia (23 cases), cortical blindness (11), aphasia (9), and ataxia (6). Factors predisposing to sequelae included prolonged coma, protracted convulsions, severe anaemia, and a biphasic clinical course characterised by recovery of consciousness followed by recurrent convulsions and coma. At follow up 1-6 months later over half these children had made a full recovery, but a quarter were left with a major residual neurological deficit. Cerebral malaria in childhood may be an important cause of neurological handicap in the tropics."
